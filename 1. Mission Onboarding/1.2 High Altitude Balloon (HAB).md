**High-Altitude Balloon**

*Overview*

High-altitude balloons (HABs) are unmanned balloons, usually filled with hydrogen or helium, that operate at altitudes ranging from 18 km to 37 km above sea level. While they are primarily used for weather monitoring, in this case, they will serve as a testing platform for our CubeSat's subsystems.

**Task**
Research the following types of balloons and decide on what would be best to test CubeSat subsystems

**Zero-Pressure Balloons**

**Super-Pressure Balloons**

**Task-2**
What are the primary components of a HAB?

**Task-3**
What are some important considerations when designing and Launching a HAB?
