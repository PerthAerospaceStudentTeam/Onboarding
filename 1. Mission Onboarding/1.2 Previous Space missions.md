# **Previous space missions**

*Overview*

Since the launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957, space exploration has evolved through hundreds of missions, each designed to address specific scientific, technological, or exploratory goals. Early missions focused on proving human spaceflight capabilities, leading to milestones such as the Apollo 11 Moon landing. Robotic probes like Voyager, Curiosity, and the James Webb Space Telescope have deepened our understanding of planets, exoplanets, and cosmic phenomena. The International Space Station (ISS) has become a hub for microgravity research, while private companies drive innovation with reusable rockets and commercial spaceflight. Today, missions like Artemis aim to return humans to the Moon, setting the stage for Mars exploration and beyond.

Before a mission starts, there needs to be a mission concept review that will detail:
- The need or gaps that the mission addresses.
- The objectives set in place are to address the need or gap.
- Who are the key stakeholders?
- How will the mission be achieved?
- An infographic describing the concept of operations.
- The main challenges of the mission.

Your Mission onboarding 


## **Task 1.2.1** 
**Objective:** Investigate previous space missions and document key findings in your logbook.

**Instructions:**

1. Select at least four past(not PAST) space missions.
2. For each mission, record the following:
   - Mission Need: Why was the  mission undertaken? What problem or scientific question does it aim to address?
   - Mission Objective: What were the primary and secondary goals?
   - Key stakeholders: Who benefits or is concerned with the mission?
   - Risks and Challenges: what were some of the key challenges that shaped the design of the mission?
   - Innovations & Design Choices: Any unique technological advancements, engineering decisions, or breakthroughs?

**Deliverable**
A logbook entry containing detailed notes on four or more missions.

## **Task 1.2.2**
**Objective:** Report how needs, risks and challenges impact design decisions.

**Instructions:**

Write about;
1. How different needs can impact mission planning, objectives, and execution;
2. How different challenges can drive Innovation and design choices in Space missions.

You can use resources like the Curtin Library, Google Scholar, and reputable space agency websites to enhance your assignment. 
Make sure to incorporate specific details and relevant data, and maintain a consistent citation style of your choice for referencing sources.

**Deliverable:**
A structured report addresses the impact of needs, risks and challenges on design choices.
