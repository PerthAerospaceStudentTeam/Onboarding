**Previous space missions**

*Overview*

Since the launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957, space exploration has evolved through hundreds of missions, each designed to address specific scientific, technological, or exploratory goals. Early missions focused on proving human spaceflight capabilities, leading to milestones such as the Apollo 11 Moon landing. Robotic probes like Voyager, Curiosity, and the James Webb Space Telescope have deepened our understanding of planets, exoplanets, and cosmic phenomena. The International Space Station (ISS) has become a hub for microgravity research, while private companies drive innovation with reusable rockets and commercial spaceflight. Today, missions such as Artemis aim to return humans to the Moon, setting the stage for Mars exploration and beyond.

There are several different types of missions, and they can be cat
