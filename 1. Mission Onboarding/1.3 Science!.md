# Missions and Payloads: Exploring CubeSat Missions

*What are you trying to accomplish?*

## 1. Overview

This lesson focuses on  understanding the objectives behind CubeSat missions, emphasising Low Earth Orbit (LEO) operations. CubeSats offer several advantages: they are cost-effective to construct, modular in design for easy customisation or modification, lightweight and compact for convenient launches, and can be mass-produced when required for a mission.

## 2. Background

Before beginning your research, consider the following points:
- **Mission Objective**: CubeSat missions can serve various purposes, from scientific research and technology demonstration to Earth observations and communications.
- **Advantages of CubeSats**: They are less expensive than traditional satellites, allow rapid prototyping, and can be tailored to specific mission needs.
- **Current Focus**: Although there are many types of missions, this tutorial focuses on those conducted in LEO.

## 3. Task
your task is to research various CubeSat Missions. Follow these steps:

**A. Research Methodology**
-  **Identify Sources**: Use academic journals, industry reports, reputable space agency websites, and mission databases.
-  **Search Strategies**: Consider keywords and/or phrases such as "CubeSat mission objectives," "LEO CubeSat research," "CubeSat payload design," and "CubeSat case studies."
-  **Documentation**: Create a table or a mind map to record the following for each mission:
  - *Mission name and date.*
  - *Primary objective(s).*
  - *Payload and technology used.*
  - *Identified need or problem addressed.*

**B. Analysis**
- **Mission Need**: Evaluate the specific need or gap that the mission addressed. What challenge or scientific question was it designed to overcome?
- **Technology and Implementation**: Note any innovative payloads or modular design features that helped achieve the mission objectives.

**C. Report your Findings**
- **Summarise your Research**: Write a concise report with an overview of your findings. Highlight similarities and differences between missions.
- **Critical Reflection**: Explain how the design and execution of each mission  contributed to its  overall success. Discuss any lessons learned that could inform future CubeSat missions.
  
## 4. Learning Outcomes
At the end of this lesson, you *should* be able to define what a mission is, the common challenges CubeSats face and how design choices impact mission outcomes.
