**Missions and Payloads**

*What are you trying to accomplish?*

The first step in planning a mission is to understand its purpose. Mission types range from low-earth orbit communications to deep-space research.
If you are interested, [here](https://www.nasa.gov/missions/) is a list of missions NASA has accomplished. PAST currently is only concerned with Low Earth Orbit(LEO) missions.

CubeSats offer several advantages: they are cost-effective to construct, modular in design for easy customization or modification, lightweight and compact for convenient launches, and can be mass-produced when required for a mission.
