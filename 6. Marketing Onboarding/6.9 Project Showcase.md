# Project Showcases
## Background
Showcasing projects is an effective way of displaying the team's efforts and increasing our exposure.
Just like at PIN, you should be able to look at the different projects each department has.

Unfortunately, most projects don't have photos or models to show for itself, so marketing these projects at events and online is a difficult task.
Working on a project showcases is a great way to gain experience over all of PAST's marketing aspects and improve your technical knowledge.

## Project Outcomes
- ✅ Liase with project members to understand the project
- ✅ Ensure there is visual documentation of the project (photos and/or models)
- ✅ Creating a poster or [social media post](https://www.instagram.com/p/C_4yjh6PrAg/?img_index=1) marketing the project
- ✅ Ensure media complies with current Branding Guidelines
