# PAST Merch (Clothing)

## Background
Merchandise helps us build a stronger brand identity, sense of belonging, professionalism, and credibility.
It makes PAST more recognisable and increase the team's exposure.

We have already made a start on team polos, so we would love to explore more merch options ðŸ˜Ž.
Some examples include:
- Designing custom waterbottles (**High Interest ðŸš¨**)
- Stratos mission patch (**High Interest ðŸš¨**)
- Lanyards / chains
- Tote bags
- Caps / Hats

## Project Objectives

- Gather inspiration / references to build designs from
- Design concept designs for merchandise suitable for the team.
- Obtain and take on feedback from recruits and other team members.
- Finalise your design(s) in an appropriate format e.g., .svg, .eps, .ai, etc.
- Investigate supplier/manufacturer options
- Document findings in an appropriate form

## Resources to get you started!
- It would be in your best interest to take inspiration from PAST's brand guidelines.
- If you don't have a Pinterest account already, make one! This is the go-to platform for inspiration and will be your saving grace when you are in need of ideas. Other apps like Cosmos are good, but Pinterest is best.
