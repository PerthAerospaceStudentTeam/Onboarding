# PAST Merch (Clothing)

## Background
Merchandise plays a key role in building PAST’s identity both internally and externally. Well designed merch helps foster a sense of belonging within the team, presents a professional image to partners and sponsors, and increases PAST’s visibility at events, launches, outreach activities, and in everyday life.
PAST has already taken its first step with team polos. This project aims to expand our merchandise range with items that are practical, high quality, and aligned with PAST’s branding and mission.
Merch should feel like something team members are proud to wear and use, not just a logo placed on a product.

We have already made a start on team polos, so we would love to explore more merch options 😎.
Some examples include:
- Designing custom waterbottles
- Jackets
- Mission patches (**High Interest 🚨**)
- Lanyards / chains
- Tote bags
- Caps / Hats

## ☑️ Project Objectives
By the end of this project, you should aim to:

- Collect inspiration and references that align with PAST’s visual identity
- Develop clear design concepts for one or more merch items
- Iterate designs based on feedback from recruits and senior team members
- Finalise designs in appropriate, production ready formats such as .svg, .eps, or .ai
- Research potential suppliers or manufacturers for the chosen items
- Document your process, decisions, and findings clearly

This project balances creativity with real world constraints such as cost, manufacturability, durability, and branding consistency.

## Scope and Expectations

This is not a “one and done” design task. You are expected to:

- Explore multiple concepts before settling on a final direction
- Justify your design decisions using references and constraints
- Consider how items will be used in practice, for example events, launches, daily use, or outreach
- Think about scalability, including reordering in the future or adapting designs for different missions
- The project will not include production/printing, but your work should be detailed enough that the team could confidently proceed to manufacturing.

## Suggested Workflow

You may structure your work roughly as follows:

### 1. Research and Inspiration

- Review PAST’s brand guidelines
- Collect examples of merch from:
  - University teams
  - Space, aerospace, and engineering organisations
  - Student societies and research groups
- Identify what works well and what does not

### 2. Concept Development

- Select 1–3 merch items to focus on
- Produce rough sketches or digital mockups
- Explore variations in colour, layout, and placement
- Pay special attention to mission patches if you choose to work on them

### 3. Feedback and Iteration

- Share concepts with other recruits and team members
- Collect structured feedback
- Refine designs based on this feedback

### 4. Final Design

- Prepare final designs in appropriate vector formats
- Ensure files are suitable for printing or embroidery
- Include clear notes on colours, dimensions, and materials where relevant

### 5. Supplier Investigation

- Research manufacturers or suppliers
- Compare:
  - Pricing and minimum order quantities
  - Lead times
  - Customisation options
  - Location and shipping considerations
- Summarise pros and cons of each option

### 6. Documentation

- Compile your work into a short report or shared document
- Include:
  - Inspiration and references
  - Design rationale
  - Final designs
  - Supplier research and recommendations


## Deliverables

At minimum, your documentation should include:
- A small collection of inspiration references
- Final design files in a suitable format
- Mockups showing how the merch would look in use
- A short document summarising your process and findings
- Clear communication is just as important as strong visuals.


## Resources to Get You Started

- PAST brand guidelines should guide all design decisions
- Pinterest is strongly recommended for collecting inspiration and mood boards
- Other platforms such as Cosmos or Behance can also be useful
- Look at how space agencies, CubeSat teams, and research labs handle branding and patches


## Notes

- You do not need to be a professional designer to succeed at this project. Thoughtful research, clear reasoning, and willingness to iterate matter more than polished visuals early on.
- If you are unsure at any stage, ask questions and share progress early. This project is as much about collaboration as it is about design.
