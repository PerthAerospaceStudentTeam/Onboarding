# PAST Merch (Clothing)

## Background
Having our own merch would be awesome for building a stronger sense of belonging, professionalism, credibility and overall
help shape our team identity. It also makes PAST more recognisable and help spread awareness of the team.

To start off with, we would love to have our shirts/polos for team members to wear. We want something simple but
recognisable. We would also like to have our own custom bomber jackets in the future ðŸ˜Ž

## Project Objectives
- Design concept designs for clothing merchandise suitable for a space team.
- Obtain and take on feedback from recruits and other team members.
- Produce 3 design options for each clothing item for the team to vote on.
- Select suppliers within the team's budget in mind.

## Resources to get you started
- It would be in your best interest to take inspiration from PAST's brand guidelines.
- Perhaps work with other members to fundraise for Merch!
- A PAST member had the idea to have custom PAST patches to sew onto PAST bomber jackets, the patches representing the projects
  they have worked on hehehe
