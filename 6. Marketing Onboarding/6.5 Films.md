# PAST Films (Commercial)

## Background

PAST aims to increase its external exposure through short-form films, with a primary focus on producing a thirty-second commercial. This commercial is intended to attract new sponsors and be screened around university campuses and at PAST events.

The project has an existing script that has gone through several drafts but has stalled at the execution stage. While some shot ideas have been tested, the commercial has not progressed to a complete filmed version. The main blocker has not been resources, but time and coordination.

This project exists to break that deadlock.

The immediate goal is not to produce a final, polished commercial, but to:
- Finalise a working script
- Prove the concept end-to-end
- Demonstrate that the commercial can be filmed, edited, and delivered

A draft version filmed on a phone, without professional equipment, is a **successful outcome** if it clearly demonstrates the story, pacing, and visual flow of the commercial.

## Project Objectives

By the end of this project, you should aim to:

- Review and refine the existing commercial script
- Finalise a script that is ready to film
- Translate the script into a practical filming plan
- Create a shot list and rough storyboard
- Plan locations, people, and logistics required for filming
- Film a draft version of the commercial using a phone or basic equipment
- Edit the draft into a complete 30-second video
- Identify what would be required to scale the draft into a professional production

This project values **execution over perfection**.

## Scope and Expectations

This project focuses on momentum and proof of feasibility. You are expected to:

- Treat the existing script as a starting point, not a sacred artifact
- Make pragmatic decisions that prioritise filming over endless revision
- Work within constraints such as limited time, locations, and equipment
- Focus on storytelling, clarity, and pacing rather than production quality
- Deliver something tangible that the team can react to and build on

Professional equipment and locations are not required for the draft.

## Suggested Workflow

### 1. Script Review and Finalisation
- Review the current script and previous revisions
- Identify:
  - Unclear messaging
  - Overly ambitious shots
  - Sections that do not translate well to video
- Finalise a script suitable for a 30-second runtime

### 2. Visual Translation
- Convert the script into:
  - A shot list
  - A rough storyboard (hand-drawn or digital)
- Identify which shots are:
  - Essential
  - Optional
  - Nice to have

### 3. Filming Plan
- Decide:
  - Locations
  - People involved
  - Time required
- Plan a minimal filming session that can realistically be executed
- Consider permissions and access requirements

### 4. Draft Filming
- Film all planned shots using a phone or basic camera. You can use friends or family for actors.
- Focus on:
  - Framing
  - Movement
  - Coverage
- Do not aim for perfection

### 5. Draft Edit
- Edit the footage into a complete 30-second draft
- Add:
  - Temporary text
  - Placeholder music or sound
- Ensure the narrative and pacing are clear

### 6. Reflection and Next Steps
- Document:
  - What worked
  - What did not
  - What would improve with professional equipment
- Outline a clear plan for producing a final, high-quality version

- A shot list and/or storyboard
- A simple filming plan
- A complete draft commercial (phone-filmed is acceptable and expected)
- A short write-up describing lessons learned and recommendations for a professional shoot
