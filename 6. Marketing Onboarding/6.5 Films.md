# PAST Films
## Background
PAST seeks to further increase our exposure through films. Currently, the team has our sights set on developing a commercial further increase our exposure.

This thirty-second commercial is meant to attract new sponsors and be played around various campuses. The script has gone through several drafts and is awaiting filming.
If you are a keen film-maker and would like to get this show on the road, this is the perfect project for you.

Currently, we have a script and have tested out some shots, but have not had the time to execute this ourselves. We have the resources available to do professional filming and have video editing licenses ready.
