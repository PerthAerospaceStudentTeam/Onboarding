# Marketing Onboarding

The Marketing department specializes in strategically promoting our projects and ensuring our achievements are recognised. It's not just about making things look good; it's about building a professional brand that resonates with students, sponsors, and industry partners.

Marketing members could be involved in graphic design for marketing material, website development, social media, creating marketing strategies, designing merchandise, writing newsletters etc. Marketing members should be familiar with PAST's brand guidelines and understand visual elements and principles. Not only that, they should keep up to date with the projects and progress happening within the team to be able to market it well.

If you would like to be a Marketing member there should be evidence of Marketing project work in your logbook.
