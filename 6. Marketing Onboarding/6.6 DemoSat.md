# PAST DemoSat

## Background

DemoSat is a play on words between “Demonstration” and “CubeSat”. It is a visual and physical model used to show what PAST’s CubeSat looks like and how it is structured, without exposing or risking flight hardware.

Online, there are very few high-quality CubeSat models available, and most require payment or restrictive licences. PAST aims to develop its own DemoSat model that can be freely used for outreach, education, sponsorship discussions, and online visualisation. In the longer term, this work will support the manufacture of an improved physical DemoSat for events and demonstrations.

You may have already seen PAST’s current DemoSat, a green and white 3D printed CubeSat structure used for outreach. This model is lightweight, robust, and effective for demonstrations, but it is intentionally simple. The next step is to create a more refined and informative digital model.

The focus of this project is **only** the 3D digital model. This model will later be used to:
- Produce renders and animations for the website and social media
- Inform improvements to future physical DemoSat builds
- Support outreach and sponsor engagement

## Project Objectives

By the end of this project, you should aim to:

- Understand the purpose and structure of a CubeSat at a high level
- Create an improved 3D model of PAST’s DemoSat
- Accurately represent major CubeSat subsystems and external features
- Prepare the model for use in renders and simple animations
- Document your modelling process so it can be reused and extended by future team members

The model does not need to be flight-accurate, but it should be realistic, consistent, and clearly communicate how a CubeSat is laid out.

## Scope and Expectations

This project sits at the intersection of technical understanding and visual communication. You are expected to:

- Learn enough about CubeSat systems to model them meaningfully
- Prioritise clarity and educational value over extreme detail
- Keep the model modular and easy to update
- Work within realistic CubeSat form factor constraints
- Document decisions, assumptions, and shortcuts

You are not expected to design flight hardware or internal electronics in detail.

## Suggested Workflow

### 1. Research and Familiarisation
- Learn the basics of CubeSat form factors and subsystems
- Identify key external and internal components to represent
- Review existing DemoSat photos and any available references

### 2. Tool Familiarisation
- Set up and learn the basics of a 3D modelling tool such as Blender or Spline
- Understand:
  - Mesh modelling
  - Basic materials and textures
  - Scene setup

### 3. Modelling
- Create the CubeSat structure to scale
- Add major features such as:
  - Solar panels
  - Antennas
  - Access panels
  - Key internal volumes or placeholder components
- Keep geometry clean and organised

### 4. Materials and Visuals
- Apply simple materials and colours aligned with PAST branding
- Set up lighting and camera angles
- Produce still renders that clearly show the model

### 5. Rendering and Animation (Optional)
- Create simple animations such as:
  - Rotation
  - Exploded views
  - Subsystem highlights
- Ensure outputs are suitable for use on the website and socials

### 6. Documentation
- Document:
  - Modelling decisions
  - File structure
  - Export settings
  - How to modify or extend the model
- Include screenshots where helpful

---

## Deliverables

At minimum, your documentation should include:

- A complete 3D DemoSat model file
- A small set of rendered images
- Optional short animations if time permits
- A short document explaining:
  - What was modelled
  - What was simplified or omitted
  - How someone else can reuse or extend the model

---

## Skills and Outcomes

By completing this project, you will gain experience in:

- 3D modelling using tools such as Blender
- Understanding CubeSat systems at a conceptual level
- Visual communication of technical systems
- Basic rendering and animation workflows
- Documenting technical and creative processes

## Does This Suit Me?

If you enjoy animation, 3D modelling, or visual storytelling, this project is a great fit. It is well suited to both beginners looking to get started and more experienced modellers wanting to apply their skills to an aerospace context.

Animation is increasingly important in combining design and engineering communication. In 2025, a film created entirely in Blender, *Flow*, won an Oscar, highlighting how powerful these tools have become!!
