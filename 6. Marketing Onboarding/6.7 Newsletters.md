# PAST Newsletters
## Overview
Currently, PAST Newsletters are short summaries of the team's developments within the last month (formally called Monthly Newsletters). 
Directly available from the website, newsletters are a primary way for interested people to learn more about the team.
We would like to expand from just monthly updates and produce content for project developments, events, milestones and so much more.

## Project Outcomes
- ✅ Develop skills in creative writing
- ✅ Learn all about the team and make tons of friends!
- ✅ Coordinate with other members to gather information, images and hand-off newsletters for potential social posts
