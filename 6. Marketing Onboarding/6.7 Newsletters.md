# PAST Newsletters

## Background

PAST newsletters are concise summaries of the team’s developments over a given period, formally known as Monthly Newsletters. They are publicly available on the PAST website and act as a key communication channel for students, sponsors, alumni, and the wider community to stay informed about what the team is doing.

Currently, newsletters focus primarily on high-level monthly updates. There is an opportunity to expand their scope and usefulness by including more varied and engaging content, such as:
- Project developments and technical breakthroughs
- Upcoming events, launches, and workshops
- Key milestones, awards, and recognitions
- Member spotlights and short interviews
- Community outreach and engagement activities

Broadening the content will allow newsletters to better capture the depth of work happening within PAST, while also increasing visibility, engagement, and continuity between updates.

## Project Objectives

By the end of this project, you should aim to:

- Understand the purpose and audience of PAST newsletters
- Review past newsletters and identify opportunities for improvement
- Contribute written content for one or more newsletter sections
- Coordinate with other team members to gather updates, images, and quotes
- Ensure written content is clear, accurate, and aligned with PAST’s tone and branding
- Prepare content that can also be repurposed for social media or website updates

---

## Scope and Expectations

This project focuses on communication, storytelling, and coordination rather than technical depth. You are expected to:

- Write clearly and concisely for a broad audience
- Proactively reach out to project leads and team members for information
- Balance technical accuracy with accessibility
- Meet reasonable deadlines to support regular publication

This is intentionally a **lighter workload project**. It is considered a *half project* and is best complemented by another project with a similar or light time commitment. For example, pairing this with a social media, outreach, or design-focused project is encouraged.

## Notes

This project is ideal for members who enjoy writing, communication, and storytelling, or who want a lower-intensity project alongside another commitment. Consistency and reliability are more important than volume.

If you are interested, coordinate with the Marketing or Communications lead to access previous newsletters and publishing timelines.
