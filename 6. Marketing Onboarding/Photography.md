# Capturing more of PAST

## Background
Throughout 2024, not many photos of the team or its projects were taken. Marketing's aim for 2025 is to enhance the team's visual documentation and build a more comprehensive photo archive.
The limiting number of photos makes it difficult to produce social media posts and other marketing material since there isn't much material to use e.g., only a single photo of a project.

## Project Outcomes
- Be able to capture more photos of the team at meetings, events and projects, ensuring they are documented and filed appropriately e.g., 2025/March/PIN#1/xxx.jpg
- Ensure photos of people who haven't signed Media Consent Forms aren't released and are noted

## Considerations
When taking photos, always be mindful of people's privacy and personal preferences.
-Ensure that individuals are aware of when and why their photos are being taken, as well as how they will be used.
-If someone is uncomfortable or requests their photo not be shared, respect their wishes and delete the image if necessary.
-Prioritising transparency and consent helps foster a positive and respectful team environment while still achieving marketing goals.
