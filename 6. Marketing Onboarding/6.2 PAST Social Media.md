# PAST Social Media

## Background

PAST primarily engages with the public through its Instagram profile. Compared to the website, Instagram allows prospective members, sponsors, and the wider community to quickly understand who we are, what we do, and how the team is structured, all without navigating multiple pages.

To date, PAST’s social media presence has focused on general updates, meeting highlights, launches, and social events. While this content is valuable, there is a clear opportunity to strengthen our presence by:
- Expanding into Instagram Reels
- Producing more team-focused and behind-the-scenes content
- Improving consistency and visual identity across posts

A stronger and more intentional social media presence helps PAST:
- Reach more like-minded and passionate students
- Attract potential sponsors and collaborators
- Showcase the team’s technical work and culture
- Share the journey of building and launching aerospace projects with a wider audience

## Project Objectives

By the end of this project, you should aim to:

- Understand and apply PAST’s Branding and Social Media Guidelines
- Identify strengths and gaps in PAST’s current social media content
- Brainstorm content ideas that address these gaps
- Develop a social media plan or content calendar
- Create at least one piece of social media content (reel, post, or story)
- Collect and incorporate feedback from PAST recruits and team members

If your content is approved, it may be posted on PAST’s official social media channels 😎.

## Scope and Expectations

This project is both creative and strategic. You are expected to:

- Think critically about the audience (students, sponsors, general public)
- Balance professionalism with approachability
- Maintain consistency with PAST’s branding and tone
- Plan content rather than posting ad-hoc
- Be comfortable iterating based on feedback

You do not need prior social media experience, but you should be willing to experiment and learn.

### 1. Review and Analysis
- Review PAST’s current Instagram profile
- Identify what types of posts perform well
- Note areas for improvement (e.g. frequency, format, storytelling)

### 2. Research and Inspiration
- Explore social media accounts from:
  - University engineering and aerospace teams
  - Student societies and project teams
  - CubeSat and aerospace companies
- Save examples of posts, reels, and storytelling styles you like

### 3. Ideation
- Brainstorm content ideas such as:
  - Team introductions and “day in the life” clips
  - Project progress updates
  - Reels explaining subsystems or concepts at a high level
  - Launch throwbacks or build highlights
  - Recruitment-focused content
- Prioritise ideas that are simple to film and repeatable

### 4. Planning
- Create a simple content calendar
- Decide:
  - What will be posted
  - When it will be filmed
  - Who needs to be involved
  - What equipment is required
- Consider aligning posts with milestones, events, or launches

### 5. Content Creation
- Film and edit content following branding guidelines
- Add captions, hashtags, and on-screen text where appropriate

## Deliverables

At minimum, your documentation should include:

- A short summary of findings from your review of PAST’s current social media
- A list of proposed content ideas
- A simple social media plan or posting calendar
- At least one completed piece of social media content
- Notes on feedback received and changes made

Clear planning and documentation are just as important as the final content.

## Notes

You do not need to be an expert in video editing or social media strategy to succeed. Curiosity, consistency, and clear communication matter more than polished content at the start.

Share progress early and often, and do not be afraid to test new formats or ideas.
