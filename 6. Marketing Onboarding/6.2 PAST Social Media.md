# PAST Social Media

## Background
PAST primarily engages with the public through its Instagram profile. Unlike the website, Instagram allows viewers to easily explore different teams without navigating multiple sub-pages. While the team has shared general updates, meeting highlights, and social event posts, we aim to strengthen our social media presence by expanding into Instagram Reels and creating more content focused on the team itself.

Having a more active presence on our socials helps reach more like-minded and passionate students, attract sponsors, and share the team's journey to a wider audience.

## Project Objectives
- Learn how to develop content that complies with Branding and Social Media Guidelines.
- Brainstorm ideas for PAST social media content that promote the improvements you previously identified.
- Develop a social media plan / calendar for scheduling posts, when to film, etc.
- Create social media content (e.g. reel, post or story) and seek feedback from PAST recruits and members.

If approved, your work will go on the socials!
