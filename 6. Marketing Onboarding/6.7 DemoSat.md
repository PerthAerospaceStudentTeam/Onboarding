# PAST Demosat
## Overview
DemoSat is a play on words between "Demonstration" and "CubeSat"; a model to show others what the CubeSat will look like.
On the internet there exist only a handful of models, most you need to pay for. PAST would like to create our own model for outreach purposes which will, down the line, involve manufacturing a physical DemoSat!

You may have already seen [DemoSat](https://www.instagram.com/p/C_4yjh6PrAg/?img_index=2), our green/white 3D printed CubeSat structure. This serves as an easy, yet powerful, way to demonstrate what a CubeSat will look like. It's light enough to handle and it strong enough not to break (perfect for demonstration!). An improved model is the next step in the process.

The 3D model will serve as a way to visualise DemoSat through a digital platform e.g., the website, and the physical model will be one we take to outreach and sponsor events. This project only focuses on the 3D model.\

## Project Outcomes
- Understanding in 3D modelling software e.g., [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
- Foundations in CubeSat systems (knowing which components are which and its purpose)
- Learning how to compose an image and video for rendering
- Documenting your process (so others can understand it and replicate it in the future AKA the continuation of knowledge)

## Does this suit me?
If you're an animation fanatic, or are looking for opportunities to get started, this project is perfect for you.
Animation has become a strong way in combining design and coding knowledge. In 2025, a film entirely made inside of [Blender](https//www.blender.org/) called [Flow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82WW9dVbglI) won an Oscar!
