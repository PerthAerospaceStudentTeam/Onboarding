# Budget Tracker

## Background
PAST needs an effective and reliable way to manage project budgets across multiple initiatives. With several projects running in parallel, each with different funding allocations, milestones, and timelines, it is critical to maintain oversight to ensure financial accountability. Currently, budget monitoring is fragmented and largely manual, which increases the risk of overspending, missed deadlines, or lack of visibility into financial performance. A structured tracking system will provide transparency, improve decision-making, and ensure projects stay within their allocated resources.

## Objectives
- The budget tracker should be a centralised, easy-to-use MS Excel tool with the following capabilities:
- Track individual project budgets: Allow input and monitoring of each projectâ€™s total allocation, expenditure to date, and remaining funds.
- Notifications for budget exceedance: Implement automatic highlighting or alerts (e.g., conditional formatting, formulas, or VBA macros) when spending approaches or exceeds the allocated budget.
- Budget timeline management: Provide a visual timeline (such as Gantt-style charts or progress bars) to show planned expenditure against actual spend over the project lifecycle.
- Milestone pings: Include milestone checkpoints with budget allocations and actual spend comparisons. This could also include automated reminders or visual indicators when milestones are due or overspending occurs.
- Reporting & summaries: Generate a dashboard or summary sheet showing the financial health of all projects at a glance, with filters for individual project details.
- Scalability & usability: Designed so it can be expanded as new projects are added without significant rework, and structured in a way that is accessible to both technical and non-technical users.
