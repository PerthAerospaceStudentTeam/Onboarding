# Budget Tracker

## Background

PAST runs multiple projects in parallel, each with its own scope, milestones, timelines, and funding sources. As the team grows, so does the complexity of managing budgets across these initiatives. Maintaining clear financial oversight is essential to ensure accountability, avoid overspending, and support informed decision-making by project leads and leadership.

Currently, budget tracking is fragmented and largely manual. This makes it difficult to:
- See the overall financial health of the team at a glance
- Track spending against project milestones
- Understand how different funding sources are being used
- Identify risks early, such as projects approaching budget limits

This project aims to design and implement a structured, scalable, and user-friendly **budget tracking system**, primarily using Microsoft Excel, that can be adopted across PAST.

## Project Objectives

By the end of this project, you should aim to design a centralised MS Excel-based budget tracker with the following capabilities:

- **Project-level budget tracking**
  - Input and track each project’s total allocated budget
  - Record expenditure to date
  - Automatically calculate remaining funds

- **Multi-source funding tracking**
  - Support multiple funding inputs (e.g. grants, sponsorships, university funding)
  - Track how much funding is available from each source
  - Record how much each project spends from each funding source
  - Clearly show remaining balances per funding source and per project

- **Budget exceedance notifications**
  - Use conditional formatting, formulas, or macros to highlight when:
    - Spending approaches budget limits
    - Budgets are exceeded
  - Make risk states immediately visible to users

- **Budget timeline management**
  - Include a visual representation of planned vs actual spend over time
  - Use tools such as:
    - Gantt-style charts
    - Progress bars
    - Cumulative spend curves

- **Milestone-based tracking**
  - Associate budget allocations with key project milestones
  - Compare planned vs actual spend at each milestone
  - Include visual indicators or reminders when milestones are due or at risk

- **Reporting and summaries**
  - Provide a dashboard or summary view showing:
    - Overall financial health
    - Project-level status
    - Funding source utilisation
  - Enable filtering or drill-down into individual projects

- **Scalability and usability**
  - Allow new projects and funding sources to be added easily
  - Ensure the tool is usable by both technical and non-technical members
  - Minimise manual effort and duplication

## Scope and Expectations

This project focuses on **system design and usability**, not accounting compliance or auditing. You are expected to:

- Design a clear and logical Excel structure
- Use formulas, formatting, and basic automation effectively
- Prioritise clarity and robustness over complexity
- Document how the tracker works so others can use and maintain it
- Consider how the tracker will be used month-to-month, not just set up once

Advanced features such as VBA macros are optional, not required.

## Suggested Workflow

### 1. Requirements Gathering
- Identify:
  - Types of projects currently running
  - Typical funding sources
  - Reporting needs of project leads and leadership
- Review any existing tracking spreadsheets or processes

### 2. System Design
- Define:
  - Sheet structure (e.g. inputs, projects, funding sources, dashboards)
  - Data flow between sheets
  - Naming and formatting conventions

### 3. Implementation
- Build the Excel tracker incrementally
- Implement formulas, conditional formatting, and charts
- Test with example data and edge cases

### 4. Visualisation and Reporting
- Create summary views and dashboards
- Ensure key information is visible at a glance
- Validate that views are intuitive for non-technical users

### 5. Documentation and Handover
- Write clear instructions on:
  - How to add projects and funding sources
  - How to log expenses
  - How to interpret warnings and summaries
- Include screenshots where helpful

## Deliverables

At minimum, your documentation should include:

- A completed MS Excel budget tracker file
- A description of the spreadsheet structure and logic
- Instructions for adding new projects and funding sources
- An explanation of alerts, indicators, and dashboards
- Example data demonstrating correct use
- Notes on limitations and suggested future improvements

---

## Skills and Outcomes

By completing this project, you will gain experience in:

- Financial tracking and budgeting for technical projects
- Designing scalable spreadsheet-based systems
- Data visualisation and reporting
- Translating organisational needs into practical tools
- Documentation and handover for shared systems

## Notes

This project is critical to PAST’s operational maturity. A well-designed budget tracker will directly support better decision-making, funding transparency, and long-term sustainability. The emphasis should be on reliability, clarity, and ease of use rather than overly complex automation.
