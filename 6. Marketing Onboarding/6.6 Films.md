# PAST Films
## Background
PAST seeks to further increase our exposure through films. Currently, the team has our sights set on two films: (1) commercial; (2) biographical documentary.

### Commecial
This thirty-second commercial is meant to attract new sponsors and be played around various campuses. The script has gone through several drafts and is awaiting filming.
If you are a keen film-maker and would like to get this show on the road, this is the perfect project for you.

### Biographical-Documentary
PAST's biographical documentary will focus on a certain member in the team as they work towards developing the High-Altitude Balloon (HAB).
Although Bio-Docs do not follow the same structure as other films (since you cannot plan something that hasn't happened), it will require a story.
If you're excited to work on a film from the ground up, then you will love this project.

## Project Outcomes
- Gaining experience in script-writing
- Understanding the basics of videography
- Learning how to book venues / location access
- Basics of Video Editing
