# PAST Social Media

## Background
PAST has an Instagram, Facebook and LinkedIn account. We would like to have a more active presence on our socials to help
recruit passionate students, attract sponsors, and share the team's journey to a wider audience.

In addition to making project-update posts, some members have expressed wanting to incorporate more fun reels to the Instagram,
because we are cool like that ðŸ˜Ž

## Project Objectives
- Evaluate PAST's social media and identify 3 possible improvements.
- Brainstorm ideas for PAST social media content that promote the improvements you previously identified.
- Create social media content (e.g. reel, post or story) and seek feedback from PAST recruits and members.

If approved, your work will go on the socials!
