# PAST Website
## Background
The website is the forefront of the team's branding presence, users should be able to learn all about the team and be redirected to any relevant sources.
Our website however, has recently undergone redevelopment and  requires attention for further detailing.

## Project Objectives
- Investigate some of the website guidelines and understand the process to website development and deployment
- Familiarise yourself with drafting and construct wireframes to reflect your inspiration and ideas
- Learn how to utilise prototyping software (Figma / Adobe XD) to test out your ideas and gather feedback from other recruits
- Ensure your design(s) and prototype(s) comply with standards and are ready to implement on our publishing platform
- Employ optimisation techniques to ensure the website operates on all devices and doesn't require NASA internet to view
