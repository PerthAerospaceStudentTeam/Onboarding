# PAST Website

## Background

The PAST website is the primary public facing platform for the team and serves as the foundation of our online presence. It is often the first place prospective members, sponsors, collaborators, and the general public go to learn who we are, what we do, and how to get involved.

The website should clearly communicate PAST’s mission, structure, projects, and achievements, while also acting as a central hub that redirects users to relevant resources such as social media, documentation, and external partners.

The website has recently undergone redevelopment and now requires further refinement, detailing, and optimisation to ensure it is polished, accessible, and easy to use across all devices.

## Project Objectives

By the end of this project, you should aim to:

- Understand the overall website development and deployment workflow
- Familiarise yourself with wireframing and information architecture to translate ideas into clear layouts
- Design wireframes that reflect your research, inspiration, and proposed improvements
- Learn how to use prototyping tools such as Figma or Adobe XD to create interactive prototypes
- Gather and incorporate feedback from recruits and team members
- Ensure designs comply with accessibility and usability standards
- Prepare designs that are practical to implement on PAST’s publishing platform

---

## Scope and Expectations

This project focuses on design thinking, usability, and real world constraints. You are expected to:

- Think from the perspective of different users, for example:
  - Prospective recruits
  - Sponsors and industry partners
  - General public and students
- Maintain consistency with PAST’s branding and tone
- Prioritise clarity and simplicity over visual complexity
- Consider accessibility from the start, not as an afterthought
- Justify design decisions with reasoning and references

You are not expected to write production code, but your designs should be detailed enough that they can be handed directly to a developer.

## Suggested Workflow

### 1. Review and Analysis
- Explore the current PAST website
- Identify strengths and weaknesses in:
  - Navigation
  - Content structure
  - Visual hierarchy
  - Responsiveness
- Note any gaps or areas for improvement

### 2. Research and Inspiration
- Review other CubeSat and aerospace organisation websites
- Investigate best practices in university and technical project sites
- Reference accessibility standards such as WCAG 2.2
- Collect examples of layouts, interactions, and content presentation you find effective

### 3. Wireframing
- Draft low fidelity wireframes to explore layout and structure
- Focus on content hierarchy and user flow rather than visual styling
- Iterate on wireframes based on early feedback

### 4. Prototyping
- Create interactive prototypes using Figma or Adobe XD
- Simulate navigation and basic interactions
- Test prototypes with other recruits and team members

### 5. Feedback and Iteration
- Collect structured feedback on:
  - Usability
  - Clarity of information
  - Accessibility
- Refine designs based on feedback

### 6. Readiness for Implementation
- Ensure designs align with the constraints of the publishing platform
- Document key design decisions and assumptions
- Prepare handover notes for developers if required

## Deliverables

At minimum, you should submit:

- A short summary of your website review and key findings
- Wireframes for one or more pages
- An interactive prototype created in Figma or Adobe XD
- Notes on accessibility considerations
- A brief summary of feedback received and how it was addressed

Clear documentation is as important as the visual design itself.
