# PAST Lapel Pins

## Background
A PAST member found [a (seemingly) legit offer](https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=805679214692049&id=100057499327166&mibextid=xfxF2i&rdid=Qd5caJiHLSp7HDz3#)
for "free" custom products - wristbands, lanyards, lapel pins, metal pens. We have agreed that the lapel pins look like the
best option.

We would love for some Marketing recruits to create a design that could be custom made into these lapel pins for PAST members
to wear at events (currently we use dodgy 3D printed ones LOL). 

## Project Objectives
- Create concept designs that are suitable to be made into custom lapel pins.
- Ask and take on feedback from PAST members/recruits
- Produce 3 final designs that PAST members can vote on.
- Contact [the company](https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=805679214692049&id=100057499327166&mibextid=xfxF2i&rdid=Qd5caJiHLSp7HDz3#)
  asking how to order to custom products.
- Liase with the company to successfully order the items! ðŸ™‚
