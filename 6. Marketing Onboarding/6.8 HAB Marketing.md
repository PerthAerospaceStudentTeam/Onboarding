# High Altitude Balloon Marketing (HAB02)

## Background

PAST’s second High Altitude Balloon mission (HAB02), expected to launch in **Q4 2026**, represents a major step forward from our initial HAB flight. Unlike the first mission, HAB02 will carry **actual CubeSat payloads and subsystems**, making it a critical technical milestone as well as a high-impact outreach opportunity.

HAB02 bridges the gap between early demonstrations and full CubeSat integration. It provides a compelling narrative that showcases not only experimentation, but progression, maturity, and increasing technical capability within the team.

This mission is an opportunity to:
- Demonstrate real subsystem testing in a near-space environment
- Highlight the evolution from HAB01 to HAB02
- Strengthen credibility with sponsors, industry, and the space community
- Create high-quality marketing assets that support recruitment, sponsorship, and outreach well beyond the launch itself

With a structured and forward-looking marketing strategy, HAB02 can be positioned as a flagship event in PAST’s roadmap towards CubeSat launch.

## Project Objectives

By the end of this project, you should aim to:

- Develop a comprehensive marketing strategy for HAB02, covering:
  - Pre-launch
  - Launch-day
  - Post-launch phases
- Clearly communicate the technical significance of HAB02, including:
  - CubeSat payload testing
  - Subsystem validation
  - Progression towards flight readiness
- Identify and prioritise communication channels such as:
  - Social media platforms
  - University and faculty newsletters
  - Student clubs and societies
  - Local and national media
  - STEM education and space-focused organisations
- Create and schedule targeted content, including:
  - Countdown and milestone posts
  - Behind-the-scenes subsystem development
  - Team interviews and spotlights
  - Teaser visuals and short videos
- Coordinate launch-day coverage, including:
  - Live updates
  - Photography and video capture
  - Clear messaging around mission objectives and outcomes
- Plan post-launch content to maintain momentum, such as:
  - Mission recap posts
  - Payload and subsystem results summaries
  - Visualisations and highlights
- Prepare branded physical and digital assets to ensure a professional and cohesive presence

## Scope and Expectations

This project is strategic and long-term. You are expected to:

- Think ahead to a Q4 2026 launch timeline
- Align marketing milestones with technical development milestones
- Balance technical accuracy with accessibility for non-technical audiences
- Maintain consistency with PAST branding and tone
- Document plans clearly so they can be executed by future team members

This project focuses on planning and coordination rather than day-of execution alone.
