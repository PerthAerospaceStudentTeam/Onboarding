# High Altitude Balloon Marketing

## Background
PAST’s High Altitude Balloon (HAB) launch is fast approaching, presenting a rare and valuable opportunity to showcase our capabilities, innovation, and team spirit. As the first undergraduate team in Western Australia to undertake such a mission, we are in a unique position to generate public interest, inspire future students, and attract attention from media, industry, and the wider community.

This event is not only a milestone for our technical achievements but also a chance to strengthen the PAST brand identity, build credibility within the space and engineering community, and create engaging content that can be repurposed for future recruitment, sponsorship proposals, and outreach.

With the right marketing plan, we can turn a single launch day into an ongoing story — one that reaches audiences well beyond the immediate participants and leaves a lasting impression.

## Project Objectives
- Develop a comprehensive marketing strategy for the HAB launch, including pre-launch, launch-day, and post-launch activities, to ensure consistent and impactful messaging.

- Prepare branded physical and digital materials, including banners, merchandise, and press kits, to ensure a professional and cohesive presence.
