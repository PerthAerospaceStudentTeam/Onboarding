# Getting Started! üìö

To get started, please look at the [Onboarding Timeline](https://github.com/PerthAerospaceStudentTeam/Onboarding/blob/main/0.%20Resources/Onboarding%20Timeline.md) to get an idea of how Onboarding is structured and the milestones you should be aware of.

Please find other Onboarding Resources here which you can refer to throughout Onboarding üí™

## Recruit Expectations ü´°
The success of a Space Mission depends on the team driving it. A single project failing could lead to mission failure. 
We are looking for members who hold themselves to high standards, take initiative, persevere through learning curves, 
and are able to commit time to a project. There will be some expectations throughout Onboarding:

### 1. Logbook ‚úçÔ∏è
- **You must keep a logbook.**
- This logbook serves to record all the things you have learned with evidence (images, screenshots, diagrams,
notes etc).
- We would would much favour a recruit who did not finish a project but whose logbook showed they learnt a lot
  compared to a recruit who claimed to complete multiple projects yet submitted a scarce logbook. 
- You can find a logbook template (Word doc) in this folder, but feel free to customise it however you want.
- Please save and share a link to your logbook with a PAST HR member.
- **At the end of Onboarding, logbooks will be reviewed and used decide who makes it into the team, so take pride in maintaining it!**

### 2. Onboarding Sessions ü§ù
- You are encouraged to work together and use the discord server to discuss projects and meet awesome new people!
- We will be running weekly Onboarding Sessions where you can work on your projects with fellow recruits, and get support from PAST members.
- Times for Onboarding Sessions will be posted in the Recruits Discord Server
