# Documentation Resources

## ‚úçÔ∏è Logbook
Your logbook's purpose is to document the development of your skills, record your project's progress, keep yourself accountable and serve as a reference when creating your Design Concepts and Overview Document.

You may customize the formatting of your logbook how you please.

Logbooks will be submitted at the end of the Onboarding period and reviewed, so take pride in maintaining it!

## üìë Design Concepts and Overview Document
The Design Concepts and Overview Document is detailed documentation and specifications of your projects work, for the entirety of the design process. Unlike your logbook, where you can dump all your notes, this document should be well structured so that any member reading it can understand the design decisions you made and why. 

Upon a project's completion, a "Lessons Learnt" and "Future Work" section should outline the important skills and knowledge gained from working on the project, and what how the project's work could be extended moving forward.
