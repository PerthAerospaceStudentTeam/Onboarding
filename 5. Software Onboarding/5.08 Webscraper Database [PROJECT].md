# Webscraper Database
This project can be split among two people and has more of a focus on teamwork. One person will develop a webscraper to gather tracking data from SatNOGs. The other will create a searchable database to store the data. 

## Background 
Database managment is important for scientific operations as the amount of data produced can quickly become overwhelming if left unmanaged. A searchable database is useful not just for the ground station; being able to specify a select period of data for transmission helps to reduce the bandwidth required for a telemetry broadcast. 

## Project Deliverables
- Webscraper that can gather requested data from a website of your choosing
- Searchable database containing scraped Satnogs data
- Efficient transfer of web scraper data to the database
