# Software Onboarding

The Software department specializes in CubeSat flight software and/or Ground Station software. This could involve working on Command and Data Handling (C&DH), writing drivers
other CubeSat subsystems (e.g. power distribution), and software for radio communications (e.g telemetry, commanding uplink and downlink, data visualisation).

Software Onboarding involves getting familiar with software tools used (e.g. STM32CubeIDE), researching flight computer architectures, and working with members to 
develop strategies to command and handle data from different CubeSat subsystems.

If you would like to become a Software member, you must have some evidence of software project work in your logbook.
