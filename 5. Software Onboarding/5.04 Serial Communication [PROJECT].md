# Serial Communication
I2C and SPI are two of the most common communication protocols you will encounter in embedded systems. They are typically used for short-distance wired communication between integrated circuits and microcontrollers. Since they are encounted frequently, it is good to have an understanding of how the protocols are implemented.
