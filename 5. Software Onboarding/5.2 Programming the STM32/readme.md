# Programming the STM32
The STM32 family of microcontrollers is primarily what we use as the flight computer. 

## First Project 
1. Download and install STM32CubeIDE: https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html
2. Once the install process has finished launch the software and create a new STM32 Project. You may need to wait a few minutes while it downloads files.
