# Programming the STM32
The STM32 family of microcontrollers is primarily what we use as the flight computer. 

## First Project 
This will walk you through the steps required to create a simple STM32 Project that blinks one of the onboard LEDs. 
1. Download and install STM32CubeIDE: https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html
2. Once the install process has finished, launch the software and create a new STM32 Project. You may need to wait a few minutes while it downloads additional files.

3. Enter the part number into into the search bar (L432KC) and select the nucleo board then click "Next >".

4. Give the project a name. Something that includes the part number and function is recommended. e.g. "L432KC_Blink"
5. Keep the options are at their default values and click "Finish". You may need to wait while it downloads all the API files.
