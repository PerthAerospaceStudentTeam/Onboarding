# Programming the STM32
The STM32 family of microcontrollers is primarily what we use as the flight computer. 

## Video Resources
- [Getting Started with STM32 and Nucleo Part 1](https://youtu.be/hyZS2p1tW-g?si=03hjzHC9kvGC5h2D) this video is similar to the following tutorial and can help provide addtional context. Be aware that they are using a different nucleo board so the pin configuration will differ. 

## First Project 
This will walk you through the steps required to create a simple STM32 Project that blinks one of the onboard LEDs. A more detailed tutorial that includes the setup and use of additonal hardware features can be found on the discord in the channel [onboarding-resources](https://discord.com/channels/1326364517881352272/1337048190041587826).  
1. Download and install STM32CubeIDE: https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html
2. Once the install process has finished, launch the software and create a new STM32 Project. You may need to wait a few minutes while it downloads additional files.

3. Enter the part number into into the search bar (L432KC) and select the nucleo board then click "Next >".

4. Give the project a name. Something that includes the part number and function is recommended. e.g. "L432KC_Blink"
5. Keep the options at their default values and click "Finish". You may need to wait while it downloads all the API files.

Once the project has been created you will be presented with the Pinout & Configuration screen. We need to do some additional setup before we can start running code. 

6. On the left side of the window, expand the "System Core" catagory and click on "SYS"
7. Select the "Debug" dropdown and select "Serial Wire". Notice that two of the pins on the diagram have turned green and been assigned to SWDIO and SWCLK respectively.

8. To assign a pin to drive the onboard LED click the pin labelled "PB3" and assign it to GPIO_Output from the menu. Then right click to assign it a user label. "LED" is recommended.

9. Click the "Clock Configuration" tab at the top of the screen. If requried, run the automatic clock solver.

10. Press "Ctrl+S" to save. A pop-up will appear asking if you would like to generate code. Click "yes". 

11. Click "yes" when the prompt to switch perspectives appears. 

12. `main.c` should open in the IDE window automatically. Select it from the left sidebar if it is not.

13. Locate the `while(1)` loop. Above `/* USER CODE END WHILE */` add the following lines of code
```
HAL_GPIO_TogglePin(LED_GPIO_Port, LED_Pin);
HAL_Delay(1000);
```
14. Click "Project > Build Project"

15. Connect the STM32 board to your PC via the USB Type-A to Micro-B cable. 
16. Click "Run > Debug As > STM32 Application"

17. When asked to create a new debug configuration, leave everything as default and click "OK"
18. Click "yes" when asked to switch to debug perspective 
19. Click the green play button to resume code execution. You should observe LD3 blink on and off on the board.

20. You can pause the code execution and step through it manually using the "step over" arrow if you wish.

21. Click the red square to terminate execution when you are done.
