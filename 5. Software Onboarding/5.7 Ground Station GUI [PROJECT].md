# Ground Station Graphical User Interface
This project focuses on turning the data we get back from the cubesat into readable information. 

## Background 
- Displaying information graphically makes it easier to track and spot trends.
- This approach produces a high level overview of the mission operations, which is useful when presenting to team members or stakeholders who may be lesser familar with the technical details of the project. 
- In the same vein, it provides an easy source of information for marketing to use in outreach. 

## Project Deliverables
- Research what data would typically be included in a satellite telemetry broadcast.
- Choose a hyperthetical mission and determine what data its telemetry would include. Justify your choices. 
- Create an interface to display this information in an easily readable manner.
