# Device Drivers 
Gain experience writing device drivers and confirm your code works with a testboard. 

## Background 
Drivers act as a form of encapsulation, hiding the low level functionality of the hardware from the rest of the code. This is achieved by enclosing the hardware behaviour in a function that only exposes the high level behaviour to the rest of the system. 

The Functional FLight Storage (FFS) subsystem is used by the flight computer to store any data that is too large to keep in RAM. The Github repository for subsystem can be found here: [PAST - Function Flight Storage](https://github.com/PerthAerospaceStudentTeam/Functional_Flight_Storage/tree/main)

## Project Deliverables
Create your own implementation of the drivers for FFS. You will need to be able to support both reading and writing data.

## Tips
- Try looking at the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) that STM has created for their boards as a starting point.
