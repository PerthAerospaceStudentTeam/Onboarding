# Real-Time Operating System

## Background 
An operating system manages the allocation of system resources to the various tasks that need to be performed. Well known examples of an OS include: Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android. These are all focused on providing the smoothest experience for the user. In an embedded system environment we will typically use a real-time OS which is designed to meet strict timing deadlines to ensure that the system can respond quickly to its environment. We will be making use of FreeRTOS because it is free to use and has package support built into the STM32CubeIDE.
