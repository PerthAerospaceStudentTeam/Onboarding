# Real-Time Operating System

## Background 
An operating system manages the allocation of system resources to the various tasks that need to be performed. Well known examples of an OS include: Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android. These are all focused on providing the smoothest experience for the user. In an embedded system environment we will typically use a real-time OS which is designed to meet strict timing deadlines to ensure that the system can respond quickly to its environment.
