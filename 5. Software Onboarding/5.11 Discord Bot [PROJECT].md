## Discord Bot
Project to improve Control-Cubey. Our Discord bot used in the onboarding server. 

## Background 
Control-Cubey is a very basic bot that was setup to automate some of the annoucement messages in the server. It is written in C++ and makes use of the D++ library to connect to Discords API. Team members have expressed interest in the bot having greater functionality, but everyone is currently busy with other technical projects. That's where you come in. 

## Project Deliverables
- Create your own fork of the Control-Cubey repo and expand its capabilities. These features could include, but are not limited to:
  - Keeping track of attendance by tallying messages sent to #apologies-and-the-like
  - Track total messages sent by members of the servers and automatically award badges when they pass a milestone
  - 
- Test that the bot works by connecting it to a personal Discord server.
