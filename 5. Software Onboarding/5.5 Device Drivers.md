# Device Drivers 

Drivers act as a form of encapsulation, hiding the low level functionality of the hardware. 

Drivers take low level software that interfaces directly with hardware and enclose it in C functions that only expose the high level functionality to the rest of the system. 

## Tasks 
The Functional FLight Storage (FFS) subsystem is used by the flight computer to store any data that is too large to keep in RAM. 
Create your own implementation of the drivers for FFS. You will need to be able to support both reading and writing data. 

## Tips
Try looking at the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) that STM has created for their boards as a starting point.
