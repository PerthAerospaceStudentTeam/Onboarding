# Machine Learning with ESP32 Camera 
Build a star tracker by appliying machine learning to input from the ESP32 camera module. 

## Background 
Leveraging machine learning would allow for a star tracker to be built using off the shelf components at a much lower cost compared to purching an existing sollution. 

## Project Deliverables
- Show that you can receive data from the camera module. 
- Select an image recognition algorithim to use. Justify your decision. 
- Apply image recognition to the collected data and succesfully detemine the devices orientation

###### Stretch Goal
- Perform the recognition in real-time and test the project with the night sky.
