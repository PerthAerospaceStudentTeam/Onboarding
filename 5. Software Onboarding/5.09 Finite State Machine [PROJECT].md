# Finite State Machine
This project invloves creating a finite state machine that can control the behaviour of LEDs. 

## Background 
A finite state machine (FSM) is a mathematical model used to represent a system the can be in exactly one state out of a finite number of possible states. This can help simplify a complex system by dividing its behaviour discrete states and actions that respond to specific stimuli.  

## Project Deliverables
- Design a FSM that controls the behaviour of a LED connected to a microcontroller board. 
    - Two push buttons will be used to control the LED. 
    - One button should cycle the state, the other toggles the functionality within each state. 
- State behavior:
    - On/Off
    - morse code presets (SOS, HELLO)
    - morse code (student name) 
 
###### Stretch Goal
- Add a third button that can toggle the brightness of the LED, regardless of what state it is in.
