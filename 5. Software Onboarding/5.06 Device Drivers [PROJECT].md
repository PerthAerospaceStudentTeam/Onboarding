# Device Drivers 
Gain experience interpreting component data sheets and simple circuit schematics, writing device drivers, and confirm your code works with a testboard. 

## Background 
Drivers act as a form of encapsulation, hiding the low level functionality of the hardware from the rest of the code. This is achieved by enclosing the hardware behaviour in a function that only exposes the high level behaviour to the rest of the system. 

This project will be making use of IMU breakout testboards developed by the ADCS department. 

## Project Deliverables
- Write a C function that can poll the IMU.
- Write a C function that can poll the magnetometer.
- You are not required to do anything fancy with the ouput of these functions, just displaying it to the terminal is ok.
- Combine both functions into single file that can be treated as a library.
- Add addtional functionality to your library. This could include:
    - The ability to return readings from both sensors iin the same function call and being able to request the data of only one sensor.
    - The option to return multiple sensor readings in sequence.
    - Adding a function to return the internal temperature reading of the IMU.

## Tips
- You should ensure that any code you write to interface with the hardware encapsulates the underlying funcitonality required to do its job. Your functions should be easy to use by a person that is unfamiliar with the underlying hardware. 
- Try looking at the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) that STM has created for their boards as a starting point. 
- Make sure to comment your code
