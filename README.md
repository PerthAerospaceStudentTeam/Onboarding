# Welcome to Onboarding! :rocket:

Congratulations on becoming a PAST recruit! üéâ *YIPPEE!* üéâ

Onboarding involves exploring CubeSat projects, upskilling yourself in areas that interest you through projects, getting familiar with PAST and meeting cool people üòé.
Throughout 8 weeks of Onboarding, you have the freedom to choose from an awesome selection of project/s which ones you would like to tackle and delve into.
If you have no idea where to start, do not worry! Projects have resources to help you get started, and don't hesitate to ask a HR member if you need some guidance selecting
one to begin with. 
Some projects are also more guided than others, so we reccommend doing those first if you want to
build up some confidence üòä

That being said, we will certainly **not** be holding your hand throughout the process. We will not provide the answers and leave a lot of things open for you to figure out. 
You will often need to find your own resources to answer your own questions (the internet is your best friend). 
Consider this a taste of what it is like to work on an actual CubeSat project, as you will be expected to navigate projects more ambiguous 
that the ones here if you end up becoming a PAST member.

In this repository you will find a collection of projects waiting to be investigated. These projects are grouped into our departments: 
1. Mission
2. Avionics
3. ADCS
4. Mechanical
5. Software
6. Mission
7. Marketing
8. Human Resources

You are not limited to the projects in this repository. If you have any ideas about what could be most useful to do, then please take initiative to communicate with the relavent people and work on it! We highly encourage you to do this.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask in the PAST Recruits Discord Server or message a PAST member.
Direct any formal enquiries to past@curtin.edu.au.

## Recruit Expectations ü´°
The success of a Space Mission depends on the team driving it. A single project failing could lead to mission failure. 
We are looking for members who hold themselves to high standards, take initiative, persevere through learning curves, 
and are able to commit time to a project. Hence, there will be some expectations throughout Onboarding.

### 1. Logbook ‚úçÔ∏è
- **You must keep a logbook.**
- This logbook serves to record all the things you have learned with evidence (images, screenshots, diagrams,
notes etc).
- We would would much favour a recruit who did not finish a project but whose logbook showed they learnt a lot
  compared to a recruit who claimed to complete multiple projects yet submitted a scarce logbook. 
- You can find a logbook template (Word doc) in this folder, but feel free to customise it however you want.
- Please save and share a link to your logbook with a PAST HR member.
- **At the end of Onboarding, logbooks will be reviewed and used decide who makes it into the team, so take pride in maintaining it!**

### 2. Onboarding Sessions ü§ù
- You are encouraged to work together and use the discord server to discuss projects and meet awesome new people!
- We will be running weekly Onboarding Sessions where you can work on your projects with fellow recruits, and get support from PAST members.
- Times for Onboarding Sessions will be posted in the Recruits Discord Server
