# Welcome to Onboarding! :rocket:

Congratulations on becoming a PAST recruit! ðŸŽ‰ *YIPPEE!* ðŸŽ‰

Onboarding involves exploring CubeSat projects, upskilling yourself in areas that interest you through projects, getting familiar with PAST and meeting cool people ðŸ˜Ž.
Throughout 8 weeks of Onboarding, you have the freedom to choose from an awesome selection of project/s which ones you would like to tackle and delve into.
If you have no idea where to start, do not worry! Projects have resources to help you get started and don't hesitate to ask a HR member if you need some guidance selecting
one to begin with. 
Some projects are also more guided than others, so we recommend doing those first if you want to
build up some confidence ðŸ˜Š

## What do I do in Onboarding?
You will select a project or projects to work on for the 8 week duration while keeping a logbook. Refer to the [Onboarding Timeline](https://github.com/PerthAerospaceStudentTeam/Onboarding/blob/main/0.%20Resources/Onboarding%20Timeline.md) for specific tasks you should complete each week. 

**To join a department, you must have evidence of that department's work in your logbook.**

In this repository, you will find a collection of projects grouped into our departments:
1. Mission
2. Avionics
3. ADCS
4. Mechanical
5. Software
6. Marketing
7. Human Resources

You are not limited to the projects in this repository. If you have any ideas about what could be most useful to do, then please take the initiative to communicate with the relevant people and work on it! We highly encourage you to do this. If you express an interest to get more involved you will naturally be integrated with the team more!

## What now?
Navigate to the Getting Started Folder and take a look at the [Onboarding Timeline](https://github.com/PerthAerospaceStudentTeam/Onboarding/blob/main/0.%20Resources/Onboarding%20Timeline.md) for the tasks you should complete each week.

## Important Notes
Often, we will not provide the answers and leave a lot of things open for you to figure out. 
You will often need to find your own resources to answer your own questions (the internet is your best friend). 
Consider this a taste of what it is like to work on an actual CubeSat project, as you will be expected to navigate projects more ambiguous 
than the ones here if you end up becoming a PAST member.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask in the PAST Recruits Discord Server or message a PAST member.
Direct any formal enquiries to past@curtin.edu.au.
