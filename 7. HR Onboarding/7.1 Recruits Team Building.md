# Recruits Team Building
This project involves organising a team building event/activity for Recruits and PAST Members to do together. 

## Background
Team Building is important for team members to get to know each other more, and promote interactions between members who may 
work in different areas of the team. Events or activities can be a great way to achieve this. It would be beneficial for 
a team building event/excercise to be organised to bring together Recruits and PAST Members.

## ☑️ Project Deliverables
1. Brainstorm at least 5 ideas for team building events in your logbook.
2. Plan a team building activity/event for your fellow recruits and PAST members.
3. Organise the event, including location, time/date, any resources required.
4. Create promotional material to announce and invite members to the event.
5. Have the event happen!

## Resources to get you started
Here are some ideas from some PAST team members 😆
