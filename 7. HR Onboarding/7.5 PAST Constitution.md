# PAST Constitution
This project involves improving PAST's constitution. 

## Background
PAST's constitution has been a topic of debate and issues for a long time. There have been complaints about the beaurocracy it
has created and the time it has wasted for team members üò≠. We would like to revise the constitution so it doesn't need to be changed
every time we would like to try implement a new process. Additionally, not all members are aware of what is in the constitution,
and it is not enforced.

## ‚òëÔ∏è Project Deliverables
1. Read and understand PAST's current consitution.
2. Brainstorm at least 5 improvements to the constitution, e.g. removing unecessary sections, simplifying the structure.
3. Create a constitution change proposal which outlines the changes you would like to make to the constitution, backed up
   with sufficient reasoning.
4. Create a powerpoint summarising the constitution changes.
5. Pitch the Constitution changes to the team.
