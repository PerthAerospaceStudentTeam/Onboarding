# Website Bios
This project involves interviewing PAST Members and writing short biographies of members for the PAST website.

## Background
The PAST Website has a [team section](https://perthaerospace.com/about) which highlights the members of the team. We would like
a short biography or description under each PAST member so website viewers can get to know the team! Biographies are also 
useful for the team to get to know each other more personally as well.

## ☑️ Project Deliverables
1. Develop questions to ask PAST members to obtain interesting facts about them to be used in a bio. 
2. Develop a short bio for yourself, to use as an example.
3. Organise short interviews with PAST members to get to know them, and take notes to develop bios.
4. Use your notes to create bios for each PAST member. There can be internal bios (to be read within the team) and shorter ones
   for the website.
