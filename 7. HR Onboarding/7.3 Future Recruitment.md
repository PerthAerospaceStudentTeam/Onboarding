## Background
PAST is a relatively new team that is still developing processes, one important one being recruitment. There is large room for improving PAST's recruitment process. 

## ☑️ Project Deliverables

2. Create an improved Diagram outlining PAST's recruitment process.
3. Identify any issues or confusing/inefficient with the current recruitment process in your logbook.
4. Gather feedback from Recruits about PAST's current recruitment process.
- This could involve developing questions, conducting interviews, creating surveys etc.
- Summarise the feedback in your logbook.
2. Use the feedback gathered to come up with at least 3 suggestions to improve the recruitment process.
3. Create a powerpoint that summarises a revised recruitment process, backed with reasoning from the feedback you collected.
4. Pitch your revised recruitment process to the team.
