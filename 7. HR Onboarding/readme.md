# HR Onboarding

The Human Resources department is responsible for supporting the learning and development of PAST members, and the team as a whole, recruitment and onboarding, organising events, and outreach. The work of HR is crucial to fostering an awesome team
environment!

If you would like to become a HR member, you must have evidence of HR work in your logbook. If you develop an interest in HR after Onboarding, then please speak to a HR member, we would love more people to help out. 

NOTE: If you have ideas for a project not specified on this GitHub, please talk to a HR member (@Annabelle (HR onboarding) on dicord).
