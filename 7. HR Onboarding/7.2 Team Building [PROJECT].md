# Recruits Team Building
This project involves improving PAST's constitution. 

## Background
Team bonding is important for team members to get to know each other more, and promote interactions between members who may 
work in different areas of the team. 
Team building activities are important opportunties to improve a team's cohesion, collaboration and communication skills.

Events or activities can be a great way to achieve either of these. It would be beneficial for a team bonding or building event/excercise to be organised to bring together Recruits and PAST Members.

## ☑️ Project Deliverables
1. Brainstorm at least 5 ideas for team bonding/building events in your logbook.
2. Plan a team building activity/event for your fellow recruits and PAST members.
3. Organise the event, including location, time/date, any resources required.
4. Create promotional material to announce and invite members to the event.
5. Have the event happen!
