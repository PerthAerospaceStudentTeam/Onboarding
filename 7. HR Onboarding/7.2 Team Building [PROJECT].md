# Recruits Team Building
This project involves planning (and potentially organising/running) a team building activity for Recruits and PAST members.

## Background
Team building activities are important opportunties to improve a team's cohesion, collaboration and communication skills. It would be useful to have a repertoire of teambuilding activities to run when there's an opportunity!

## ☑️ Project Deliverables
1. Brainstorm at least 5 ideas for team building activities in your logbook.
2. Choose one team building activity to plan in more depth.
3. Plan the resources needed, where you would source them from, time limits, group size, prizes, instructions etc.
3. Make a PowerPoint Presentation for your teambuilding activity.
