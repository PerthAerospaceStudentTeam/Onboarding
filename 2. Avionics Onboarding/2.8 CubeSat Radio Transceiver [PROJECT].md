# CubeSat Radio Transceiver
This project involves designing a PCB to handle radio communications on board the CubeSat.

## Background
A transciever on a CubeSat enables communication between the satellite and the ground station. Satellite communications are a
a series of transmissions of modulated electromagnetic waves in the radio frequency range. Ground Stations send radio signals (uplink), while the satellite recieves the signal and processes it. The satellite transmits telemetry or Mission data to earth (downlink).

Some key characteristics of transceivers include: frequency bands,
modulation schemes, data rates, power consumption, and communication interface with the onboard computer.

PAST's current On-board radio trasciever is based upon the [OpenLST Design](https://github.com/OpenLST/openlst). Please reach out to PAST members if you are interested working on Radio Communications, and we can connect you with members working on Radio Comms!

## ☑️ Project Deliverables
1. Learn the basics of radio communications and summarise in your logbook. This includes transceivers, frequency bands, modulation techniques, antennas, 
2. Create a block diagram of a Transciever PCB, referring to the OpenLST design. It should include blocks such as the Transceiver/MCU, RF front end, Amplifiers, RF switches, Filtering, Oscillators, with explanations of each in your logbook.
3. Explain the considerations for PCB design for radio applications (impedance matching, RF shielding etc.) in your logbook.
4. Create a schematic for a transciever board in Altium Designer.
5. Route your own Transciever Module, referencing the OpenLST Design, in Altium Designer.
