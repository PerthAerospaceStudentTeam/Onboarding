# CubeSat Radio Transceiver

## Background
A transciever on a CubeSat enables communication between the satellite and the ground station. Satellite communications are a
a series of transmissions of modulated electromagnetic waves in the radio frequency range. Ground Stations send radio signals (uplink).
The satellite recieves the signal and processes it. The satellite transmits telemetry or Mission data to earth (downlink).
Some key characteristics of transceivers include: frequency bands,
modulation schemes, data rates, power concumption, and communication interface with the onboard computer.

Currently, PAST's CubeSat radio project is based upon the OpenLST radio transceiver design. They are having trouble debugging it, 
so it would be useful to have more members knowledgable in radio comms. ðŸ˜…

## Project Objectives
- Learn the basics of Satellite Radio Communications
- Understand the schematic of OpenLST's transceiver board and all its components
  (Transceiver/MCU, RF front end, Amplifiers, RF switches, Filtering, Oscillators)
- Understand the considerations for routing for radio applications (impedance matching, RF shielding etc.)
- Route your own Transciever Module, or talk to PAST members about working with PAST's radio team (STARCOMM) to debug their transciever module.
