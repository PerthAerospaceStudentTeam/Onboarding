# Intro to PAST Avionics Department
This is a resource for recruits to get an idea into the different divisions within the avionics department, and to help recruits choose an onboarding project based on their interests.

Avionics can be divided into three different sub-departments.

## Electrical Power System (EPS)
The EPS sub-department works on the power generation, storage and distribution for the CubeSat. 
If you are interested in:
- Power generation: Maximum Power Point Tracking project would be the most suitable project
- Power storage: Buck Converter PCB & Power Inhibits Circuit would be the most suitable project
- Power Distribution: Power Distribution Safety would be the most suitable project

## Communication and Radio Frequency (STARCOMM)
The STARCOMM sub-department works on GPS and communicating with the CubeSat during flight through using radio.
You should join STARCOMM if you have an interest in RF components (Radio Frequency). 
Suitable projects for STARCOMM are:
- Radio Dipole Antenna
- Cubesat Radio Transceiver

## Command And Processing (CAP)
The CAP sub-department works on the electronic parts of the flight computer of the CubeSat.
This is a smaller sub-department because the large majority of the work for flight computer is software oriented. 
If you are interested in joining the CAP sub-department, suitable projects are:
- Secondary Flight Storage (Avionics)
- Device Drivers (Software)
- RTOS (Software)
- Finite State Machine (Software)
