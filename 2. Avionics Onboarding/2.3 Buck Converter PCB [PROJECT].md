# Buck Converter PCB
This is a guided project involves creating a PCB to test buck converters in Altium Designer. It goes through, from start to finish, how to select components, utilise datasheets, and design a PCB in Altium.

## Background
Buck Converters are DC-DC voltage regulators. They are comprised of RLC components (resistors, capacitors, inductors) in a special configuration to optimise voltage stability
and power efficiency. A good explanation of buck converters: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6NOV6b8kxs&t=466s. 

A buck converter IC contains these components in a tiny chip, which often also has other built in 
functions like overcurrent protection. Bucks and buck-boosts are used in the EPS (Electronic Power System) of a CubeSat to step down the raw supply voltages from solar panels or batteries to stable voltages (usually 3.3V and 5V) that
other subsystems use. They a preferred over Low Dropout Regulators because they are more efficient. There are also boost converters which step up voltages. 

## ‚òëÔ∏è Project Deliverables 
1. Explain the function of Buck Converters in your logbook
2. Select suitable buck converter ICs with reasoning
3. Make a schematic in Altium Designer.
4. Route a PCB in Altium Designer folowing good PCB design practices and standards.
5. Document your design process in your logbook.

## Selecting a Buck Converter IC
What to consider in component selection:
- Design Requirements (power efficiency, current capacity, voltage stability, size etc)
- Detailed and well-documented datasheet
- Cost

Characteristics of buck converters you may want to research: switching frequency, control methods (synchronous or non synchronous), quiescent current (and their trade-offs).

To select a component, search for it on [Mouser](https://au.mouser.com/), and select the appropriate filters.

üêî **TASK 1:** Find a suitable buck converter IC to meet the following requirements:
- Input voltage > 11V
- Output voltage 3.3V or 5V (or both if you wanna go for a dual output buck)
- Greater than 2A output
- Less than $10 per chip
- Smaller number of parts e.g. capacitors, pins
- Low quiescent current
*Hint: check the datasheets!*

## Making a Schematic
üêî **TASK 2**: First we need to import the buck converter IC you selected. You can import the Buck Converter using the 
[Alitum Library Loader](https://www.samacsys.com/altium-designer-library-instructions/) and putting in the part number. It should pop up in the bottom left corner after importing.

### Reading the Datasheet
To make the schematic, we need to know how the IC works, and what is required for it to work. This is where the datasheet is useful. A components datasheet contains all information you should need to know to operate the component. You should read through it, and pay close
attention to the pin configuration, specifications, detailed description (for understanding internal circuitry), and Application and Implementation.

You can find what is needed for the IC to function through reading the Typical Application Section. This is an example for a buck-boost converter but should be similar.

üêî **TASK 3:** Read the IC datasheet and search for appropriate components for the buck IC in our application. When selecting the components, always try to adhere to the
[Avionics Recommended Electronic Components.docx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18702005/Avionics.Recommended.Electronic.Components.docx). However, for EPS applications, you should consider the power ratings of components.

### Connecting components

- Since the purpose of this PCB is to test the buck converter IC, you also want to add test points for Vin, Vout and ground.
- Other good practices for PCB design is to add indicator LEDs and reverse voltage protection (try search for ways to achieve!).
- Annotating the schematic with how it operates is important for clear documentation.
This is an example of a schematic for a buck-boost converter:

üêî **TASK 4:** 
Make a schematic diagram for your selected buck converter, applying good design practices.

## Routing the Buck
- Routing is connecting components with copper traces in a PCB.
- When routing we need to consider things like current, heat dissapation. The datasheet for voltage regulators usually have a recommended PCB layout you should follow.
- For a 2-layer PCB, you should use a ground plane (polygon pour) on the bottom layer, which serves as a voltage reference and ensures signal integrity in traces (search for how to do this or ask someone!).
- You also must also adhere to the JLC manufacturing specifications when routing, otherwise a pcb you design cannot be ordered!
- If you want a challenge, try to minimise the the space taken up by all the components.

üêî **TASK 5:** Route a 2 layer PCB for your buck converter, following guidelines. Include big pads (with holes) for Vin and GND to connect an external power source. 

The end result should end up something like this (but better lol):

These videos provide good PCB design tips:

## Checking your PCB
- Check for Design Rule Errors to make sure your board is manufacturable. Tools -> Design Rule Check
- Follow the Avionics PCB Checklist [Avionics PCB Design Final checklist.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18702104/PCB.Design.Final.checklist.xlsx) to make sure your board has no errors. 

## Final Notes + Project Extension
- You have designed an isolated test board for a buck converter, but in a CubeSat, buck converters are only a small fraction of an EPS board.
- Voltage regulators are a critical component of a CubeSat - without them there would be no stable power! Think about how you can ensure other CubeSat subsystems will always recieve regulated power even if the buck converter fails.
- An extension of this project would be CubeSat power distribution. Do some research on this if you are interested and reach out to an Avionics EPS member.
- Remember to log everything you have done and learnt in your logbook!

LETS GOOOOOO CONGRATS ON COMPLETING THIS PROJECT!! :fire: :fire: :fire:
