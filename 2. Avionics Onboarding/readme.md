# Avionics Onboarding

The Avionics Department specializes in designing, developing and testing electronic systems. This could involve
radio communications, electronic power systems, interfacing with sensors, actuators and microcontrollers. 
An Avionics member should know basic PCB design, and the theory behind the subsystem they choose
work on.

Avionics Onboarding Projects range in guidance level. Some are more guided to help build your skills, while others are more
open ended, giving you the opportunity to research and design your own system. If you end up becoming a PAST member, your work
would likely be a continuation of the research and concept development you do in Onboarding.

If you would like to become an Avionics member, there must be evidence Avionics Onboarding Project/s in your logbook.
