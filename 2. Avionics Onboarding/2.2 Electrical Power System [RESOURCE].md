# **ELECTRICAL POWER SYSTEMS**
The Electrical Power System (EPS) is a crucial subsystem of every spacecraft, which provides energy to all other onboard systems. Without it, spacecraft missions would be impossible.
The EPS consists of three primary components: the primary and secondary energy sources, along with a power control and distribution network, as illustrated in the figure below.

Primary energy sources convert fuel or other energy forms into electrical power; in the case of CubeSats, this is achieved using photovoltaic (PV) cells.
Secondary energy sources serve as storage systems that eventually deliver power to the spacecraft's various subsystems.
The power control and distribution network ensures that all spacecraft components receive the appropriate voltage and current levels as required.

NOTE:
All primary energy sources will degrade over time.
Both primary and secondary energy sources' characteristics will change over time.
Charge control of a battery system is important to maintain the lifetime and reliability of a battery system.
Pre-task: what other information would be important for the above notes? Try looking in the resources section below.

## **Task**
Research the following questions and write in short about what you find:

- **What is the expected degradation rate of solar panels in space (LEO)?**
- **How are energy storage systems (batteries, etc) sized to meet power demands during an eclipse period or peak loads?**
- **What is the maximum efficiency of a PV cell?**
- **What impact do extreme temperature variations have on power generation and storage?**
- **What kind of autonomous fault detection and recovery mechanisms exist to prevent power system failure?**
- **How is power handled during launch, transit and orbit?**
- **Can you think of any other challenges for electronics in space?**
