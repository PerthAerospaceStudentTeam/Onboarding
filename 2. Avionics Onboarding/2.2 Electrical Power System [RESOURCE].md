# Electric Power System
The Electrical Power System (EPS) is an essential subsystem that powers all other subsystems (e.g. radio communications, On-board computer, ADCS). It consists of PV Panels as primary energy source, energy storage system, power electronic converters and power distribution system (source: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9528921).

A good introduction to EPS: [Introduction to CubeSat Power Control System](https://www.unoosa.org/documents/pdf/psa/access2space4all/KiboCUBE/AcademySeason2/On-demand_Pre-recorded_Lectures/KiboCUBE_Academy_2021_OPL08.pdf)

## EPS subsystems

### Solar Panels ðŸŒž
- PV panels convert solar energy to electrical energy.
- Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) or Maximum Power Point Conversion (MPPC) is used to maximise power from the panels.
- A diode is used in series with the panels to prevent non-illuminated panels from drawing power from the sun-lit panels.

### Energy Storage ðŸ”‹
- Rechargable batteries (usually Lithium Ion) used to store energy for eclipse phases of orbit. PAST is using 18650 batteries.
- There are different battery configurations (e.g. 2S2P - two series, two parallel) which produce different capacities and voltages.

### Battery Protection ðŸª«
- Batteries must be protected for the safety and reliability of the CubeSat
- This is a requirement by CubeSat launch providers.
- Protections include: overcharging and discharging, thermal protection, short-circuit & overcurrent.
- This is achieved using battery protection ICs such as e-fuses and battery heating.

### Power Conversion ðŸ”„
- Power from solar panels and batteries fluctuate.
- Power regulators (e.g. buck converters) are required to stabilise the voltage to levels required by other subsystems. Usually 3v3 and 5V busses is used for 1U CubeSats.

### Power Distribution ðŸ”€
- Power going to subsystems should be monitored to ensure it does not exceed a safe value or drain the batteries to a critical level. 
- This is achieved using sensors such as current sensors and e-fuses. 
- Power monitors (voltage and current levels) also make up the CubeSat's telemetry.
