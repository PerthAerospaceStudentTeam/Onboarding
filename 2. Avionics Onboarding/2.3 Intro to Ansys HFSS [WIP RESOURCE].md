In PAST, we have been using Ansys HFSS for simulating antennas, however there are other software which can do this, such as MATLAB and FEKO

## Installing Ansys HFSS
Ansys HFSS can be obtained as a student license through the Ansys Electronics Desktop. This also contains other software such as Maxwell and Icepak
