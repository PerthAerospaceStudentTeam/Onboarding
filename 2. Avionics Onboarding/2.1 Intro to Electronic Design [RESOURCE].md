# Intro to Electronic Design & Altium

## Background Info
- Electronic components refer to parts of a circuit. Things like resistors, capacitors, inductors, transistors ICs, LEDs,
  when configured intentionally, manipulate electric currents and voltages to useful functions.
- Integrated Circuits (ICs) package a complex circuit into a small chip which performs specific functions, making it
  easier to achieve what you want without having to build the low level circuit.
- Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) house electronic components into small form factors, using embedded copper traces separated with dielectric substrate. This is more reliable and compact than connecting components with loose wires.

## Altium Designer
- Altium is a PCB design software.
- You will need to obtain a free student license and install Altium Designer on your device through here:
  https://www.altium.com/education/students
- PAST also has a computer with Altium installed if you need, however it is best to have it installed on your own device.

## Getting Started in Altium
There are so many online tutorials and resources to help you gain familiarity with the Altium IDE. Here are some to 
get you started:
- [Altium Designer Walkthrough](https://www.altium.com/documentation/altium-designer/tutorial-complete-design-walkthrough?srsltid=AfmBOoqkGIepiJsCApQ-1vasckeoRjSUaeAYHLYKAWCuF9ruBfx9nrcR#the-design)
- [Altium Designer Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTGzncKU5RY)
- [Altium Designer Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3aaAq2OJU5H_Jj72DObh5kNh6Nr4xNS0)
- [Common PCB Design Mistakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0X76Kbf8fQ&pp=ygUPYWx0aXVtIG1pc3Rha2Vz)
- Altium also has free online courses: [Altium Education](https://education.altium.com/)
- We encourage you to search for additional resources as well.

However, the best way to learn is by practice. Try playing around and connect up components and don't be afraid of making mistakes, e.g. you could try to make an LED blinker using a 555 timer, LEDs, resistors and capacitors. Being fluent in Altium is important to complete Avionics Onboarding Projects.

Don't hesitate to ask for help in the Recruits Discord Server!

## Important Notes
- When creating an Altium Project, you should import JLCPCB Design Rules. This gives you Design Rule Errors to ensure your PCB can be fabricated by JLCPCB, our preferred manufacturer. Find instructions in:
  [Avionics Schematic-PCB Instructions.docx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18704231/AVI-SPCB.Avionics.Schematic-PCB.Instructions.docx)
- Follow [Avionics Recommended Electronic Components.docx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18718183/Avionics.Recommended.Electronic.Components.docx) when selecting common components (resistors, capacitors, LEDs, connectors etc). The standard component footprint for passives is 0603.
- Always excercise good PCB design practices: [PCB Design Good Practices.docx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19025423/PCB.Design.Review.Checklist.before.ordering.2.docx)
