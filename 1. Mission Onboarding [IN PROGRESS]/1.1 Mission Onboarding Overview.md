#  **Mission Onboarding**

Welcome to Mission onboarding! Throughout this process, we hope you'll gain all the necessary knowledge to begin working in the PAST Mission Department. To recap, the Mission department oversees all mission-related projects and collaborates with other teams to ensure deadlines are met.

Your onboarding will involve a research project and a concept design project, both of which you must present. Additionally, you'll be required to maintain a logbook, which will be reviewed at the end of your onboarding period.
