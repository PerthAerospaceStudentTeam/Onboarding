# Live Orientation Display
This project involves using filtering techniques on sensor measurements to improve the accuracy of orientation information. You will create a visual display (live graphs or animation) of orientation.

## Background
- The relative orientation of an object, such as a CubeSat, can be computed through inertial vector measurements (magnetic field, acceleration, angular rate).
- Due to the noise, disturbances and drift of measurements, sensor data must be fused using filtering techniques (such as the complimentary filter or Kalman Filter).
- Filtering is critical to attitude determination algorithms of CubeSats, which enables accurate attitude control.
- This project is a gateway to learn about ADCS algorithms while making something visually epic in the process!

## ☑️ Project Deliverables
1. Research how different sensor filtering techniques work to provide more accurate estimations of a system's state. Summarise your findings in a table.
2. Create a flowchart explaining an algorithm that takes in sensor measurements (magnetic-field/acceleration/angular velocity vectors), computes euler angles (roll, pitch and yaw), uses filtering techniques and visualizes the data some way (e.g. rotating block, graph of euler angles over time).
3. Implement your algorithm into a program that can be uploaded to a microcontroller. Explain your code in your logbook.
4. Process real-time data by interfacing with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and microcontroller to update your data visualisation.
5. Demonstrate the function of your program to the team.
