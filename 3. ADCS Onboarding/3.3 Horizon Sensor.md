# Horizon Sensor

## Background
- PAST's future CubeSat mission may involve imaging of the earth, which requires earth (nadir) pointing capability.
- Other attitude sensors (sun sensors and magnetometers) have limitations. E.g sun sensors are unreliable during eclipse periods
and magnetometers are not highly accurate due to earth's changing magnetic field.
- Valuable attitude information (nadir direction) may be obtained through a horizon sensor.
- Horizon sensors detect points on the earth's horizon.
- The appearance of the earth is more uniform at infrared wavelengths, especially in the narrow 14â€“16um emission band of the CO2 molecule, so almost all horizon
sensors are designed to detect infrared radiation in this range.

## Project Objectives
- Evaluate the feasibility of utilising horizon sensors to achieve nadir pointing (consider space, mass, power and computing requirements, and cost.)
- Investigate estimation methods to determine the nadir vector, and methods to achieve nadir pointing from horizon sensor data.
- Search and select horizon sensors to be tested. Look into: static vs scanning sensors, Infrared sensors with relavent ranges, Thermopiles.
- Design horizon sensor system that could be integrated into our CubeSat. 
This should include a plan for mechanical, electrical and software integration. Please communicate your ideas with PAST's ADCS members.
