# Intro to ADCS
The Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) is a critical subsystem in CubeSats that manages the orientation (attitude) of the satellite in space. 
It is responsible for determining the satellite's orientation relative to some reference frame (such as the Earth) 
and controlling the orientation to achieve specific mission objectives like pointing cameras or antennas.

## Attitude Sensors
Sensors provide data that can be used to calculate the CubeSat's current attitude. Attitude Sensors can include: 
- Sun sensors
- Magnetic field sensors (magnetometers)
- Angular rate sensors (gyroscope)
- Horizon sensors
- Star trackers. 
These sensors
 provide vector measurements in the CubeSat's reference frame. For a 1U CubeSat, magnetometers, gyroscopes and sun sensors
  are most common. 

## Attitude Determination
Attitude is calculated by comparing vectors measured by sensors onboard the CubeSat (body fixed frame) with vectors in a fixed 
reference frame (e.g. Earth-Centred-Inertial frame). Attitude must first be initialised (obtain the first value) then a recursive
method of attitude estimation can be used. Methods of attitude determination include:
- TRIAD Algorithm
- Davenport's q-method
- Complimentary filter
- Kalman Filter

## Attitude Control
Actuators change the attitude of the CubeSat.
Common actuation methods for attitude control include Magnetorquers and Reaction Wheels.
Magnetorquers are variable electromagnets that interact with the earth's magnetic field to produce control torques.
Reaction wheels are spinning disks that produce a reaction torque through the conservation principle of angular momentum.
ADCS has some operational modes: 
- Detumbling
- Nadir Pointing
- Sun Tracking
