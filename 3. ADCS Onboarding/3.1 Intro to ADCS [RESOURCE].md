# Intro to ADCS
The Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) is a critical subsystem in CubeSats that manages the orientation (attitude) of the satellite in space. 
It is responsible for determining the satellite's orientation relative to some reference frame (such as the Earth), stabilising/detumbling,  
and controlling the orientation to achieve specific mission objectives like pointing cameras or antennas.

## üõ∞Ô∏è Attitude Sensors
Sensors provide data that can be used to calculate the CubeSat's current attitude. Attitude Sensors can include: 
- Sun sensors
- Magnetic field sensors (magnetometers)
- Angular rate sensors (gyroscope)
- Horizon sensors
- Star trackers. 

These sensors
 provide vector measurements in the CubeSat's reference frame. For a 1U CubeSat, magnetometers, gyroscopes and sun sensors
  are most common. 

## üõ∞Ô∏è Attitude Determination
Attitude is calculated by comparing vectors measured by sensors onboard the CubeSat (body fixed frame) with vectors in a fixed 
reference frame (e.g. Earth-Centred-Inertial frame). Attitude must first be initialised (obtain the first value) then a recursive
method of attitude estimation can be used. Some methods of attitude determination include:
- TRIAD Algorithm
- Davenport's q-method
- Filtering techniques such as: Complimentary Filter, Unscented Kalman Filter, Extended Kalman Filter.

Attitude can be parameterised in many ways, such as:
- Attitude Matrix
- Euler angles
- Quaternion

Attitude matrices and euler angles suffer from gimbal lock, i.e there is no unique solution when solving for attitude. 
This is why quaternions are generally the preferred mathematical framework to represent attitude, however they are less intuitive to understand.

## üõ∞Ô∏è Attitude Control
Actuators change the attitude of the CubeSat to a desired state.
Common actuation methods for attitude control include Magnetorquers and Reaction Wheels.
Magnetorquers are variable electromagnets that interact with the earth's magnetic field to produce control torques.
Reaction wheels are spinning disks that produce a reaction torque through the conservation principle of angular momentum.
ADCS has some operational modes of attitude control: 
- Detumbling
- Nadir Pointing
- Sun Tracking

For Detumbling, the B-dot algorithm is most popularly used. For Nadire pointing PID control is generally used.

## üõ∞Ô∏è Attitude Dynamics
Attitude dynamics refers to the equations relavent to the rotational motion of the CubeSat. These equations relate things like moment of inertia, torques, and angular rates, which may be familiar if you have previously studied Mechanics. Understanding the attitude dynamics of the CubeSat is essential to ADCS, because it enables us to model how the CubeSat will respond to control inputs, i.e. how applied torques affect the angular velocity and attitude quaternion. 

Models derived from the equations of attitude dynamics can be used to propagate the CubeSat's attitude over time (attitude representation, angular velocity).

## Notes
- Not all CubeSat missions require full attitude control. ADCS is complex and requires rigorous testing to get correct, so
  many CubeSats have limited ADCS such as passive methods of attitude control, or only detumbling capabilities.
- Detumbling does not require attitude knowledge.
