# Passive Attitude Control Methods

## Background
Attitude control can generally be categorized as either passive and active. Active methods use sensors, actuators,
and feedback algorithms, which can quickly become complex, and consume a significant amount of space and power. 
This poses the question - would it be even feasible to have active control in PAST's first 1U CubeSat? 

## Project Objectives
- Research the feasibility of active attitude control for PAST's first 1U CubeSat. How many CubeSats with active ADCS has been
successful? What ADCS methods did they use? 
- Investigate **passive** attitude control methods. Hints: permanent magnets, hysteresis rods, gravity booms.
- Investigate if passive attitude control can achieve an Earth Observation Mission.
- Design a passive attitude control method for a 1U CubeSat. Do component selection and explain your reasoning (consider mechanical integration).
