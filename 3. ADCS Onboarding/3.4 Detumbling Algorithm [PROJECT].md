# Detumbling Algorithm
This project involves learning about control laws and simulating a B-dot controller for detumbling.

## Background
- When a CubeSat is released from its deployer, it has a significant angular rate that must be reduced before mission operations can take place. 
- The B-dot controller is a common algorithm used to dampen the CubeSat's initial angular velocity.
- It is called "B-dot" because it involves reversing the rate of change (derivative denoted by dot) of the magnetic field vector (B-field vector).

## ☑️ Project Deliverables
1. Research the B-dot controller and attitude dynamics for CubeSat, creating notes in your logbook. You should include mathematical relationships for the control equation and CubeSat dynamics and annotate them.
3. Create a flow chart of how you can simulate the detumbling algorithm to produce a graph of angular velocity over time.
4. Create functions in MATLAB to:
   a.  Obtain the magnetic field in the body-fixed-frame from cartesian co-ordinates
   b. Obtain the magnetic dipole moment of a magnetorquer from supplied current
   c. Take the derivative of the state vector (using rotational and translational dynamics equations you previously studied)
5. Use these functions to simulate the detumbling algorithm and produce a graph of angular velocity over time, showing it reduces to near 0. Bonus points if you also plot the CubeSat's orbit or animate it's rotation!

## Tips
- You need to be quite fluent in linear algebra to understand the equations.
- You should add simulated sensor noise and drift to your simulation to test it's robustness.
- You will need to use the IGRF model to obtain the magnetic field in the earth inertial reference frame, and apply a transformation matrix to obtain the magnetic field in the CubeSat's reference frame.
- The state vector contains all information required to describe the CubeSat's motion. This typically includes the velocity, acceleration, quaternion and angular velocity.
