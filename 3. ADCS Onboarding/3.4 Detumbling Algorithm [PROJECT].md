# Detumbling Algorithm
This project involves learning about control laws and simulating a B-dot controller for detumbling.

## Background
- When a CubeSat is released from its deployer, it tumbles about all axes and must be detumbled before mission operations must take place. 
- The B-dot controller is a common algorithm used to dampen the CubeSat's initial angular velocity.
- It is called "B-dot" because it involves reversing the rate of change (derivative) of the magnetic field vector.

## ☑️ Project Deliverables
1. Research the B-dot controller and attitude dynamics for CubeSat, creating notes in your logbook. You should include mathematical relationships for the control equation and CubeSat dynamics and annotate them.
2. Create a flow chart of how you can simulate the detumbling algorithm to produce a graph of angular velocity over time.
3. Simulate the detumbling algorithm in a programming language of choice (e.g. Python, MATLAB) to produce a graph of angular velocity over time, showing it reduces to 0.
4. Research the relationships governing the magnetic fields produced by magnetorquers, i.e how applied currents relate to magnetic fields produced. Explain the relationships in your logbook. 
5. Create a block diagram of the closed loop control system that uses magnetic field sensor readings and applies appropriate currents to detumble the satellite.
