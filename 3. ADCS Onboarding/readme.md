# ADCS Onboarding

The Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) Department works on all the system design, software and hardware to determine
and control the orientation of the CubeSat. This involves interfacing with sensors and actuators, algorithm design, simulations and
physical testing. ADCS is critical to stabilising the satellite, optimising solar power, establishing communications and point payloads.
