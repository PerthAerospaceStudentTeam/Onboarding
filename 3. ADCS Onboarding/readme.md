# ADCS Onboarding

The Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) Department works on all the system design, software and hardware to determine
and control the orientation of the CubeSat. This involves interfacing with sensors and actuators, algorithm design, simulations and
testing. ADCS is critical to stabilising the satellite, optimising solar power, establishing communications and point payloads.

You do not need to know the intricacies of ADCS to work on ADCS projects, as you would be working on hardware or testing, but it
is still important to know the key ideas.
