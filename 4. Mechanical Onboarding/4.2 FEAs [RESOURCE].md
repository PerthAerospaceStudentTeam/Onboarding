# Finite Element Analysis

## Background
Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is a way to analyse structures you have designed in CAD programs. This can include many different types of analyses including analysing response to random vibration, stress, quasistatic acceleration, temperature variation and lots more. In PAST, we use Autodesk Inventor NASTRAN to perform FEAs - this is an add-on built into Inventor.

## Key Features of an FEA
Geometry:
- This is the 3D model you want to perform an analysis on
- For NASTRAN, you just need to open up the inventor file of your part or assembly & enter the NASTRAN environment (Environments -> Autodesk Inventor NASTRAN)

- The more complex your geometry is, the longer the FEA will take and the more likely your computer is to crash
- Try to simplify parts that are not essential to the analysis (or exclude them by right clicking & selecting "Exclude from analysis")

Idealisations:
- Similar to geometry, your idealisations represent all of the parts included in the analysis and what material they are made of
- Make sure to assign the material, otherwise your analysis will be wrong (for CubeSat structures Al-6065 or Al-7071 must be used).
- If you are performing an analysis on an assembly, each part should have its own idealisation.
- Your idealisations are shown in the feature tree under Idealisations -> Solids

- Inventor should automatically create an idealisation for you when you start a new analysis, delete this.
- To create a new idealisation, right click on "Solids" and select "New". This should bring up a dialogue box allowing you to select the geometry to include in the idealisation.

- Make sure to tick "Associated Geometry" and then you should be able to select geometry to include.
- You can also assign the material using the material dropdown (If you leave the material set as "Generic" you'll get some wacky results).

Mesh:
- In order to perform the analysis, Inventor needs to divide the faces of your part/assembly into polygons. This process is called "meshing".
- To create a mesh, right click on "Mesh Model" in your feature tree and select "Generate Mesh"

- You should see a mesh form around the outside of your part. If the meshing fails, it means your geometry is too complex or your mesh size is too big.
- You can change your mesh size by clicking on "Mesh Settings" and editing the "Element Size" value. Keep in mind that the smaller you make your element size, the longer your meshing & analysis will take. Usually the default size set by inventor is pretty good, so your geometry most likely needs to be simplified if meshing fails.

Contacts:
- Contacts tell NASTRAN which surfaces are in contact with each other so they don't phase through during the analysis (basically defining collision between the surfaces). Contacts are only necessary if you are analysing an assembly.
- NASTRAN can automatically detect contact using the button shown below:

Connectors:
- Usually the geometry of fasteners like bolts, screws and nuts is to complex to be included in an analysis. In order to simulate them, we can add a connector in NASTRAN.
- To add a connector, select "Connectors"

- Most of the time, you will want to use a "Bolt" type connector. Once you select "Bolt" the dialogue box will ask you to fill in the parameters for your bolt. The main one you need to fill out is the diameter (you can ignore the rest).

- You will also need to select the faces for the bolt head and nut. To do this, click on the boxes that say to select the geometry and then select the circular edges of the holes you want the bolt to go in.
  
Constraints:
- Constraints define the degrees of freedom that the model has (rotational or translational) and where it is fixed in place.
- To add a new constraint, right click on "Constraints" in the feature tree and select "New".

- A dialogue box will come up, asking you to select the geometry and desired constraints. Select the part or feature that you want to constrain.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b33ebde-281c-4832-be72-cd12585ced11)

- There are 6 degrees of freedom: Rotation in the x (Rx), y (Ry) and z (Rz) axes and translation in the x (Tx), y (Ty) and z (Tz) axes
- You can constrain each of the degrees of freedom individually by ticking the boxes (e.g. if you tick Rx, the feature wont be able to rotate about the x axis).
- If you want the part to be fixed, just click on the fixed option. There are similar presets for no transation and no rotation.
- NOTE: If you do not have any constraints, the analysis will fail!
  
Loads:
- Loads are forces or stresses that you are applying to the part: this is what you are analysing the response to.
- The first part of performing any FEA is determining a load case. This is a numerical value of what forces and stresses your part will experience, and should be calculated by you.
- Once you have determined a load case, create a new load by right clicking on "Loads" in the feature tree and selecting "New"

- There are many different types of loads. We will focus mainly on "Force" and "Gravity" for now.
- A dialogue should come up allowing you to define your load. For a force, you will need to select the geometry that the force is applied to.

- Forces are defined in terms of their x, y and z components. Enter these in and click "OK" to define the load.
- Gravity works in the same way, but doesn't require you to select the geometry it is applied to (it is applied uniformly across the whole part/assembly)

- You can add multiple loads to different geometry but you cannot add more than one of the same load type to the same geometry.
- NOTE: If you don't have a load, you analysis will fail!

Running the Analysis:
- Run the analysis by clicking "Run"

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b411e317-c371-4cac-9a73-70fdd8c47706)

- If it fails, look up the error code (The info on inventor isn't very helpful)
- Once your analysis finishes you'll be able to view the results in the feature tree. Click on "Von Mises Stress", "Displacement" and the other sections to view the impact on the structure.
- If you are happy with your analysis, you should try refining the mesh (decreasing the element size) and running the analysis again. If you continue doing this and your results converge, your FEA is good! If not, reconsider your load case and constraints.

Common Mistakes:
- Geometry isn't fully defined (analysis will fail)
- Element size is bigger than the features on your part (meshing will fail)
- No load or constraints or idealisations (you need all 3)
