## PCB Holder
This project involves designing a PCB Holder to aid PAST Members in soldering their boards.

## Background
When soldering components onto PCB, sometimes it is easier and safer to have the board at an angle and be able to access the
backside of the board. An adjustable PCB holder would be useful for greater control over component placement and stability of
the PCB.

## ☑️ Project Deliverables
1. Research PCB Holder Designs, identifying the components required in your logbook.
2. Develop an annotated concept design for your PCB holder. List materials required.
   Requirements:
   - The stand should allow the PCB to rotate 360 degrees.
   - The width of the holder should be adjustable.
   - The clamps should hold a firm grip of the PCB and not be shaken loose - able to hold common PCB thicknesses.
   - Investigate the best materials that will be used to manufacture the holder.
4. Create a CAD model of your PCB holder in Inventor.
5. Get the model fabricated and assembled.
