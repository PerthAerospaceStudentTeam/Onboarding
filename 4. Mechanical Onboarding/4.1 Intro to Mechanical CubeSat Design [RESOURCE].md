# Intro to Mechanical Design

## Autodesk Inventor
Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software is a way to digitally create 3D models and 2D drawings of parts and assemblies before they are manufactured. 
Autodesk Inventor is the standard CAD software PAST uses. This is because Inventor has an embedded tool called NASTRAN, a general purpose
finite element analysis (FEA) simulator developed and used by NASA. There are also great learning resources available through AutoDesk.

You need to obtain a free student license and [install Autodesk Inventor Professional](https://help.autodesk.com/view/INVNTOR/2022/ENU/?guid=odis_install_software).

## JAXA Specifications
The [JAXA specifications document](https://iss.jaxa.jp/kibouser/library/item/jx-espc_8c_en.pdf) should always be referenced when designing any part of the CubeSat Structure!
The Interface Requirements for 10cm Class Satellite is of relevance. 

## Testing
PAST has access to a vacuum chamber and vibrational test bed which can be used for testing in simulated launch or space conditions.
