# ADCS Testbed

## Background
It is difficult to test the Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) of a CubeSat in 3-axes on earth because it is difficult
to simulate the conditions of free-fall. Since ADCS is a critical subsystem of the CubeSat, having a test-bed would be
beneficial to ensure the system's flight readiness. The mechanical side of this project involves investigating methods to
simulate almost disturbance-free rotational dynamics.

One approach to this problem is to use an air bearing platform, which can often be costly and heavy. PAST's testbed 
should minimize the costs and resources required to build it. You may need to collaborate with Avionics members to design the 
electronics side. If a well-thought and feasible design is created, budget may be allocated to make the physical test-bed if
you end up becoming a full PAST member.

## Project Deliverables
1. A literature review investigating the feasibility of designing a custom test-bed.
2. At least 3 concept designs with an outline of strengths and weaknesses
3. Proof-of-concept prototype of an ADCS Test-Bed with at least 2 degrees of freedom that minimizes costs and resources required.
4. CAD model of the test platform
5. Technical drawings and bill of materials for your test-bed design.
