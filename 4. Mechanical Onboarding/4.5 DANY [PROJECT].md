# Deployable Mechanism (DANY)

## Background
Deployable CubeSat Systems such as antennas and solar panels are often held down by fishing line which melts using a burn 
resistor. This method is unreliable because the vibrations and forces during launch can damage the line and cause 
deployment to malfunction. 

DANY - Diminutive Assembly for Nanosatellite deploYables, is a deployable release mechanism developed by NASA that uses spring
loaded metal pins and is said to be more reliable. Taking inspiration from this design, PAST could benefit from a more reliable
method to deploy its systems. The development of such a project could be reused in future CubeSat missions as well.

You can collaborate with an Avionics member to develop the electronics for this project or focus on just the mechanical part.

## Project Objectives
1. A document outlining how NASA's DANY works and the benfits it provides over burn resistors.
2. CAD model of deployment mechanism.
3. A test plan for the mechanism that can be done in the PAST lab.
4. Testing of the deployment mechanism carried out, with relevant data collected and analysed.
5. An integration plan for your deployment mechanism into either the deployable antenna or solar panels (talk to mechanical lead for files)
6. A recommendation outlining whether your deployment mechanism should be used in place of burn resistors on the CubeSat.
