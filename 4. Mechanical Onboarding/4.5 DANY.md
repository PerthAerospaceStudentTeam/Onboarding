# Deployable Mechanism (DANY)

# Background
Deployable CubeSat Systems such as antennas and solar panels are often held down by fishing line which melts using a burn 
resistor. This method is unreliable because the vibrations and forces during launch can damage the line and cause 
deployment to malfunction. 

DANY - Diminutive Assembly for Nanosatellite deploYables, is a deployable release mechanism developed by NASA that uses spring
loaded metal pins and is said to be more reliable. Taking inspiration from this design, PAST could benefit from a more reliable
method to deploy its systems. The development of such a project could be reused in future CubeSat missions as well.

# Project Objectives
- Research and understand the design of NASA's DANY.
- Design a more reliable mechanism for PAST as a proof of concept.
- CAD model of deployment mechanism.
