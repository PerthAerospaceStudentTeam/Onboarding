# FlatSat
This project involves the mechanical design for a modular FlatSat, providing mounting solutions PCBs, regardless of board
size and mounting hole location.

## Background
Before everything is assembled into the CubeSat structure, electronics integration must be tested. This is more convenient
to do with everything laid out flat, allowing each PCB to be easily accessed and wires to be easily plugged and unplugged. 
A FlatSat is a structure designed for PCBs to be mounted flat and integrationto be tested. 

This project involves the mechanical design for a modular FlatSat, providing mounting solutions PCBs, regardless of board
size and mounting hole location. The design should be completely 3D printed, and consist of units that can be printed 
individually and fitted together.

## ☑️ Project Objectives
1. A document outlining the importance of a FlatSat and common approaches to electronics integration.
2. At least 3 concept designs including strengths and weaknesses of each.
3. CAD model of the chosen concept
4. Document written for Avionics members outlining assembly and board size accommodations.
5. 3D printed final model
