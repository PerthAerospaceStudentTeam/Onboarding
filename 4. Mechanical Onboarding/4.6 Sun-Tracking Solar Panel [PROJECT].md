# Sun-Tracking Solar Panel
This project involves the mechanical design for a sun-tracking solar panel mount that allows the panels to rotate about 2 axes. 

## Background
CubeSats receive their power from solar panels that are mounted to their structure. If not enough sunlight is received, the 
satellite will lose power and no longer be able to function. A sun-tracking solar panel maximises sunlight exposure by pointing
the solar panels toward the sun as much as possible.

This project involves the mechanical design for a sun-tracking solar panel mount that allows the panels to rotate about 2 axes. 
The mount should consider the current design for the CubeSat structure and provide adequate mounting for the solar panel PCBs
(talk to the Mechanical and Avionics leads for the files). The electronics do not need to be designed but the project student 
should have a top-level understanding of how it will work.

## ☑️ Project Objectives
1. A document investigating the feasibility of a sun-tracking solar panel.
2. At least 3 concept designs including strengths and weaknesses of each.
3. CAD model of sun-tracking solar panel mount.
4. FEAs showing that JAXA specifications are met.
5. 3D printed model demonstrating proof of concept.
