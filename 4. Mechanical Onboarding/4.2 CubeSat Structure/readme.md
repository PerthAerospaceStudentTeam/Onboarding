# CubeSat Structure

## Background
The CubeSat's structure is a standardized form factor of 10x10x10cm^3. There are launch provider specifications that must be considered when designing the structure, e.g. max 1.33kg, rails, maximum values for random vibration and acceleration. This
is to ensure the CubeSat structure is compatible with the launch vehicle and [deployment module](https://humans-in-space.jaxa.jp/en/biz-lab/experiment/facility/ef/jssod/). All
design requirements and considerations are specified in the [JAXA Interface Control Document.](https://humans-in-space.jaxa.jp/kibouser/library/item/jx-espc_8e_en.pdf)

We currently have a prototype structure made, but believe there could be room for improvement. Please contact a PAST Member if
you would like to have the files for our prototype CubeSat structures. Designing a structure requires working closely with the
team to ensure electrical and mechanical components interface well. Your design should also consider the ease assembly and
disassembly.

## Project Objectives
- Familiarise yourself with the Mechanical design requirements specified in the [JAXA Interface Control Document.](https://humans-in-space.jaxa.jp/kibouser/library/item/jx-espc_8e_en.pdf)
- Research different approaches to designing CubeSat structures. Communicate with PAST members about electrical and mechanical 
integration. 
- Produce Concept Designs for CubeSat Structure.
- Model the CubeSat Structure in Autodesk Inventor.
