# CubeSat Structure

## Background
The CubeSat's structure is a standardized form factor of 10x10x10cm^3. There are launch provider specifications that must be considered when designing the structure, e.g. max 1.33kg, rails, maximum values for random vibration and acceleration. This
is to ensure the CubeSat structure is compatible with the launch vehicle and [deployment module](https://humans-in-space.jaxa.jp/en/biz-lab/experiment/facility/ef/jssod/). All
design requirements and considerations are specified in the [JAXA Interface Control Document.](https://humans-in-space.jaxa.jp/kibouser/library/item/jx-espc_8e_en.pdf)

We currently have a prototype structure made, but believe there could be room for improvement. Please contact a PAST Member if
you would like to have the files for our prototype CubeSat structures. Designing a structure requires working closely with the
team to ensure electrical and mechanical components interface well. 

As we are a student team, it is likely that we will have to do lots of troubleshooting on the CubeSat. This means your design should also consider the ease of assembly and disassembly - this should be a priority when deciding on a concept.

## ☑️ Project Deliverables
1. Summary of the relevant mechanical design requirements for a 1U as specified in the JAXA Interface Control Document
2. A research document outlining different approaches to CubeSat structures including strengths and weaknesses.
3. At least 3 concept designs for a CubeSat structure that meet the JAXA requirements.
4. A CAD model of the chosen concept in Autodesk Inventor.
5. FEAs showing that the model meets the JAXA requirements.
6. Technical drawings of your structure.
7. A 3D printed model of your CubeSat structure (model should be sliced and sent to the Mechanical Lead for printing or printed by the recruit if they have access to a 3D printer).
